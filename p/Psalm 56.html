        1. Be gracious to me, O God, for man tramples on me;
        all day long an attacker oppresses me;<br><br>
        2. my enemies trample on me all day long,
        for many attack me proudly.<br><br>
        3. When I am afraid,
        I put my trust in you.<br><br>
        4. In God, whose word I praise,
        in God I trust; I shall not be afraid.
        What can flesh do to me?<br><br>
        
        5. All day long they injure my cause;
        all their thoughts are against me for evil.<br><br>
        6. They stir up strife, they lurk;
        they watch my steps,
        as they have waited for my life.<br><br>
        7. For their crime will they escape?
        In wrath cast down the peoples, O God!<br><br>
        
        8. You have kept count of my tossings;
        put my tears in your bottle.
        Are they not in your book?<br><br>
        9. Then my enemies will turn back
        in the day when I call.
        This I know, that God is for me.<br><br>
        10. In God, whose word I praise,
        in the Lord, whose word I praise,<br><br>
        11. in God I trust; I shall not be afraid.
        What can man do to me?<br><br>
        
        12. I must perform my vows to you, O God;
        I will render thank offerings to you.<br><br>
        13. For you have delivered my soul from death,
        yes, my feet from falling,
        that I may walk before God

        <p><h4>Psalm 56 is a prayer of David in a time of distress, expressing his trust in God's protection and deliverance. It highlights his confidence in God's faithfulness and recounts his enemies' attacks.</h4>

            David describes how his enemies constantly injure his cause and plot against him. They stir up strife and watch his every step, eagerly waiting for an opportunity to take his life. He appeals to God's justice, asking whether his enemies will escape punishment and expressing his desire for divine wrath to be cast upon them.<br><br>
            
            David recognizes God's care for him, acknowledging that God has kept count of his sleepless nights and collected his tears in a bottle, symbolizing God's attentiveness to his distress.
