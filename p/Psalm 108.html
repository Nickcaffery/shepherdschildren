        1. My heart is steadfast, O God!
        I will sing and make melody with all my being!<br><br>
        2. Awake, O harp and lyre!
        I will awake the dawn!<br><br>
        3. I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples;
        I will sing praises to you among the nations.<br><br>
        4. For your steadfast love is great above the heavens;
        your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.<br><br>
        
        5. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!
        Let your glory be over all the earth!<br><br>
        6. That your beloved ones may be delivered,
        give salvation by your right hand and answer me!<br><br>
        
        7. God has promised in his holiness:
        "With exultation I will divide up Shechem
        and portion out the Valley of Succoth.<br><br>
        8. Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine;
        Ephraim is my helmet;
        Judah is my scepter.<br><br>
        9. Moab is my washbasin;
        upon Edom I cast my shoe;
        over Philistia I shout in triumph."<br><br>
        
        10. Who will bring me to the fortified city?
        Who will lead me to Edom?<br><br>
        11. Have you not rejected us, O God?
        You do not go out, O God, with our armies.<br><br>
        12. Oh grant us help against the foe,
        for vain is the salvation of man!<br><br>
        13. With God we shall do valiantly;
        it is he who will tread down our foes.<br><br></p>
