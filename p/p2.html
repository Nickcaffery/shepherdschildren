      1. Why do the nations rage
and the peoples plot in vain?<br><br>
2. The kings of the earth set themselves,
and the rulers take counsel together,
against the Lord and against his Anointed, saying,<br><br>
3. "Let us burst their bonds apart
and cast away their cords from us."<br><br>

4. He who sits in the heavens laughs;
the Lord holds them in derision.<br><br>
5. Then he will speak to them in his wrath,
and terrify them in his fury, saying,
6. "As for me, I have set my King
on Zion, my holy hill."<br><br>

7. I will tell of the decree:
The Lord said to me, "You are my Son;
today I have begotten you.<br><br>
8. Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage,
and the ends of the earth your possession.<br><br>
9. You shall break them with a rod of iron
and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."<br><br>

10. Now therefore, O kings, be wise;
be warned, O rulers of the earth.<br><br>
11. Serve the Lord with fear,
and rejoice with trembling.<br><br>
12. Kiss the Son,
lest he be angry, and you perish in the way,
for his wrath is quickly kindled.
Blessed are all who take refuge in him.<br><br>

        <p><h4>Psalm 2 addresses the opposition and rebellion of nations and rulers against the Lord and His Anointed (Messiah). It depicts God's response to their defiance and conveys a message of warning and blessing.</h4>
            The psalm begins by questioning why the nations and peoples plot and rage against God and His Anointed. It describes the kings and rulers of the earth taking counsel together, seeking to break free from the authority and influence of God.<br><br>

            However, God, who sits in the heavens, laughs at their futile attempts and holds them in derision. He then speaks in His wrath and terrifies them, asserting His sovereignty and declaring His chosen King, who is placed on Zion, God's holy hill.<br><br>
            
            The psalm reveals a decree from the Lord to the Anointed (the Messiah), proclaiming Him as His Son and promising to grant Him the nations as His inheritance and the ends of the earth as His possession. The psalmist envisions the Messiah wielding authority over the rebellious nations, breaking them with a rod of iron and shattering them like a potter's vessel.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a call to wisdom and warning for the kings and rulers of the earth. They are urged to serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling. They are instructed to submit to and honor the Son, lest His anger be aroused and they face destruction. The psalm ends with a blessing for all who take refuge in the Son, emphasizing the importance of seeking shelter and finding safety in Him.<br><br></p>    
        <p><h4>Psalm 2 portrays God's ultimate authority and the inevitability of His triumph over the rebellious powers of the earth. It conveys a message of both warning and hope, urging people to recognize and submit to the reign of the Lord and His Anointed.</h4></p>
