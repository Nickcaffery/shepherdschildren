        1. To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.<br><br>
        2. O my God, in you I trust;
        let me not be put to shame;
        let not my enemies exult over me.<br><br>
        3. Indeed, none who wait for you shall be put to shame;
        they shall be ashamed who are wantonly treacherous.<br><br>
        
        4. Make me to know your ways, O Lord;
        teach me your paths.<br><br>
        5. Lead me in your truth and teach me,
        for you are the God of my salvation;
        for you I wait all the day long.<br><br>
        
        6. Remember your mercy, O Lord, and your steadfast love,
        for they have been from of old.<br><br>
        7. Remember not the sins of my youth or my transgressions;
        according to your steadfast love remember me,
        for the sake of your goodness, O Lord!<br><br>
        
        8. Good and upright is the Lord;
        therefore he instructs sinners in the way.<br><br>
        9. He leads the humble in what is right,
        and teaches the humble his way.<br><br>
        10. All the paths of the Lord are steadfast love and faithfulness,
        for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.<br><br>
        
        11. For your name's sake, O Lord,
        pardon my guilt, for it is great.<br><br>
        12. Who is the man who fears the Lord?
        Him will he instruct in the way that he should choose.<br><br>
        13. His soul shall abide in well-being,
        and his offspring shall inherit the land.<br><br>
        14. The friendship of the Lord is for those who fear him,
        and he makes known to them his covenant.<br><br>
        15. My eyes are ever toward the Lord,
        for he will pluck my feet out of the net.<br><br>
        
        16. Turn to me and be gracious to me,
        for I am lonely and afflicted.<br><br>
        17. The troubles of my heart are enlarged;
        bring me out of my distresses.<br><br>
        18. Consider my affliction and my trouble,
        and forgive all my sins.<br><br>
        
        19. Consider how many are my foes,
        and with what violent hatred they hate me.<br><br>
        20. Oh, guard my soul, and deliver me!
        Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in you.<br><br>
        21. May integrity and uprightness preserve me,
        for I wait for you.<br><br>
        
        22. Redeem Israel, O God,
        out of all his troubles.<br><br></p>
