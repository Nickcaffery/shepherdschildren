        1. Transgression speaks to the wicked deep in his heart;
        there is no fear of God before his eyes.<br><br>
        2. For he flatters himself in his own eyes
        that his iniquity cannot be found out and hated.<br><br>
        3. The words of his mouth are trouble and deceit;
        he has ceased to act wisely and do good.<br><br>
        4. He plots trouble while on his bed;
        he sets himself in a way that is not good;
        he does not reject evil.<br><br>
        
        5. Your steadfast love, O Lord, extends to the heavens,
        your faithfulness to the clouds.<br><br>
        6. Your righteousness is like the mountains of God;
        your judgments are like the great deep;
        man and beast you save, O Lord.<br><br>
        
        7. How precious is your steadfast love, O God!
        The children of mankind take refuge in the shadow of your wings.<br><br>
        8. They feast on the abundance of your house,
        and you give them drink from the river of your delights.<br><br>
        9. For with you is the fountain of life;
        in your light do we see light.<br><br>
        
        10. Oh, continue your steadfast love to those who know you,
        and your righteousness to the upright of heart!<br><br>
        11. Let not the foot of arrogance come upon me,
        nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.<br><br>
        12. There the evildoers lie fallen;
        they are thrust down, unable to rise.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 36 reflects on the contrast between the wickedness of humanity and the steadfast love, faithfulness, and righteousness of God. It describes the characteristics of the wicked, acknowledges the abundant love of God, and expresses the psalmist's trust in God's protection and ultimate judgment.</h4>
            The psalm begins by portraying the wicked person who has no fear of God and flatters themselves in their own eyes. They believe their iniquity cannot be discovered and hated. Their words are characterized by trouble and deceit, and they have forsaken wisdom and goodness. They plot evil and set themselves on a destructive path, refusing to reject evil.<br><br>

            In contrast to the wicked, the psalmist declares the immeasurable extent of God's steadfast love, which reaches to the heavens, and His faithfulness, which extends to the clouds. The righteousness of God is likened to the majestic mountains, and His judgments are deep and profound, saving both man and beast.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist recognizes the preciousness of God's steadfast love, and the refuge found in the shadow of His wings. They acknowledge the abundance of God's house and the satisfaction found in feasting on His provisions. They affirm that with God is the fountain of life, and in His light, they see light.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist prays for God to continue His steadfast love and righteousness to those who know Him and have upright hearts. They request protection from the foot of arrogance and the hand of the wicked. The psalmist expresses confidence in the downfall of evildoers, stating that they lie fallen and are unable to rise.<br><br></p>
