        1. I will extol you, O Lord, for you have drawn me up
        and have not let my foes rejoice over me.<br><br>
        2. O Lord my God, I cried to you for help,
        and you have healed me.<br><br>
        3. O Lord, you have brought up my soul from Sheol;
        you restored me to life from among those who go down to the pit.<br><br>
        
        4. Sing praises to the Lord, O you his saints,
        and give thanks to his holy name.<br><br>
        5. For his anger is but for a moment,
        and his favor is for a lifetime.
        Weeping may tarry for the night,
        but joy comes with the morning.<br><br>
        
        6. As for me, I said in my prosperity,
        "I shall never be moved."<br><br>
        7. By your favor, O Lord,
        you made my mountain stand strong;
        you hid your face;
        I was dismayed.<br><br>
        
        8. To you, O Lord, I cry,
        and to the Lord I plead for mercy:<br><br>
        9. "What profit is there in my death,
        if I go down to the pit?
        Will the dust praise you?
        Will it tell of your faithfulness?<br><br>
        10. Hear, O Lord, and be merciful to me!
        O Lord, be my helper!"<br><br>
        
        11. You have turned for me my mourning into dancing;
        you have loosed my sackcloth
        and clothed me with gladness,<br><br>
        12. that my glory may sing your praise and not be silent.
        O Lord my God, I will give thanks to you forever!<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 30 is a psalm of thanksgiving and praise for deliverance from a difficult situation. The psalmist extols the Lord for rescuing them from their enemies and restoring them to health and life.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by expressing their intention to praise the Lord because He has lifted them up and prevented their foes from rejoicing over them. They acknowledge that they cried out to God for help, and He answered and brought healing. The Lord has rescued their soul from the depths of Sheol and restored them from the pit.<br><br>

            The psalmist calls upon the saints to sing praises to the Lord and give thanks to His holy name. They reflect on the temporary nature of God's anger and the enduring nature of His favor. They recognize that while weeping may last for a night, joy comes in the morning.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist acknowledges their past confidence in their prosperity, thinking they would never be moved. However, they experienced a time when the Lord hid His face, causing them dismay. In their distress, they cry out to the Lord, pleading for mercy and questioning the purpose of their death. They ask if the dust of the grave can praise God or speak of His faithfulness. They implore the Lord to hear and be their helper.<br><br>
            
            The psalm takes a turn of transformation and rejoicing as the psalmist declares that God has turned their mourning into dancing. He has replaced their sackcloth of mourning with garments of gladness. The psalmist's glory, or their inner being, sings praises to God and will not be silent. They commit to giving thanks to the Lord forever.<br><br></p>
