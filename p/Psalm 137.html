        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 137 is a poignant psalm that expresses the deep sorrow and longing of the Israelites during their exile in Babylon. It reflects their grief and yearning for Jerusalem, their beloved city, as well as their desire for justice against their oppressors.</h4>
            The psalm begins with a vivid scene by the rivers of Babylon, where the exiled Israelites sat down and wept, remembering Zion (Jerusalem). They hung up their lyres, musical instruments used for praise and worship, indicating their loss of joy and inability to sing in their current state of captivity.<br><br>

            The captors and tormentors of the Israelites demanded songs of Zion, mocking their longing for their homeland. The psalmist questions how they could sing the Lord's song in a foreign land, where their hearts were filled with sorrow and their surroundings were hostile to their faith.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist declares their unwavering commitment to Jerusalem and their refusal to forget it. They express a powerful oath, stating that if they were to forget Jerusalem, their right hand should forget its skill and their tongue should stick to the roof of their mouth. Jerusalem holds a higher place of honor and joy in their hearts than anything else.<br><br>
            
            In verse 7, the psalmist calls upon the Lord to remember the actions of the Edomites, who rejoiced in the destruction of Jerusalem and encouraged further devastation. The psalmist desires justice for the suffering inflicted upon them.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a prayer for the destruction of Babylon and a pronouncement of blessing upon those who would repay Babylon for its treatment of the Israelites. The psalmist expresses a deep sense of anger and desire for vengeance, invoking a curse upon the Babylonians.<br><br></p>
