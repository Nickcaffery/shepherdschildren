        for the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness;
        let your right hand teach you awesome deeds!<br><br>
        5. Your arrows are sharp
        in the heart of the king's enemies;
        the peoples fall under you.<br><br>
        
        6. Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.
        The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of uprightness;<br><br>

        <p><h4>Psalm 45 is a royal psalm that celebrates a king's beauty, strength, and reign. It likely refers to an earthly king, but it also carries messianic undertones, pointing to the ultimate King, Jesus Christ.</h4>
            The psalmist's heart overflows with a pleasing theme as they address their verses to the king. They describe the king as the most handsome among men, with grace poured upon his lips, and God has blessed him forever. The psalmist encourages the king to gird his sword and ride out victoriously for the cause of truth, meekness, and righteousness. The king's enemies fall before him, as his arrows strike their hearts.<br><br>

            The psalmist acknowledges the eternal nature of the king's throne, proclaiming it as the throne of God. The king loves righteousness and hates wickedness, and as a result, God has anointed him with gladness and elevated him above his companions. The king's robes are described as fragrant with myrrh, aloes, and cassia. The psalmist depicts the king's delight in music and praises from ivory palaces.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist turns their attention to the daughter of a king, addressing her and exhorting her to forget her people and father's house and bow to the king. They anticipate that the king will desire her beauty and that the people of Tyre will seek her favor with gifts. The princess is described as glorious in her chamber, adorned with robes interwoven with gold. She is led to the king, with her virgin companions following behind her, and they all enter the palace with joy and gladness.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist concludes by proclaiming that the king will have sons who will become princes in all the earth. They declare that the king's name will be remembered in all generations, and nations will praise him forever.<br><br></p>
