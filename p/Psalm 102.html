        1. Hear my prayer, O Lord;
        let my cry come to you!<br><br>
        2. Do not hide your face from me
        in the day of my distress!
        Incline your ear to me;
        answer me speedily in the day when I call!<br><br>
        
        3. For my days pass away like smoke,
        and my bones burn like a furnace.<br><br>
        4. My heart is struck down like grass and has withered;
        I forget to eat my bread.<br><br>
        5. Because of my loud groaning
        my bones cling to my flesh.<br><br>
        6. I am like a desert owl of the wilderness,
        like an owl of the waste places;<br><br>
        7. I lie awake;
        I am like a lonely sparrow on the housetop.<br><br>
        8. All the day my enemies taunt me;
        those who deride me use my name for a curse.<br><br>
        9. For I eat ashes like bread
        and mingle tears with my drink,<br><br>
        10. because of your indignation and anger;
        for you have taken me up and thrown me down.<br><br>
        11. My days are like an evening shadow;
        I wither away like grass.<br><br>
        
        12. But you, O Lord, are enthroned forever;
        your name endures to all generations.<br><br>
        13. You will arise and have pity on Zion;
        it is the time to favor her;
        the appointed time has come.<br><br>
        14. For your servants hold her stones dear
        and have pity on her dust.<br><br>
        15. Nations will fear the name of the Lord,
        and all the kings of the earth will fear your glory.<br><br>
        16. For the Lord builds up Zion;
        he appears in his glory;<br><br>
        17. he regards the prayer of the destitute
        and does not despise their prayer.<br><br>
        
        18. Let this be recorded for a generation to come,
        so that a people yet to be created may praise the Lord:<br><br>
        19. that he looked down from his holy height;
        from heaven the Lord looked at the earth,<br><br>
        20. to hear the groans of the prisoners,
        to set free those who were doomed to die,<br><br>
        21. that they may declare in Zion the name of the Lord,
        and in Jerusalem his praise,<br><br>
        22. when peoples gather together,
        and kingdoms, to worship the Lord.<br><br>
        
        23. He has broken my strength in midcourse;
        he has shortened my days.<br><br>
        24. "O my God," I say, "take me not away
        in the midst of my daysâ€”
        you whose years endure
        throughout all generations!"<br><br>
        
        25. Of old you laid the foundation of the earth,
        and the heavens are the work of your hands.<br><br>
        26. They will perish, but you will remain;
        they will all wear out like a garment.
        You will change them like a robe, and they will pass away,<br><br>
        27. but you are the same, and your years have no end.<br><br>
        28. The children of your servants shall dwell secure;
        their offspring shall be established before you.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 102 is a prayer of an afflicted individual, pouring out their distress before the Lord. The psalmist cries out for God's attention, expressing their anguish and pleading for a speedy answer.</h4>
            The psalmist describes their suffering, feeling the passing of their days like smoke and their bones burning like a furnace. Their heart is struck down and withered, causing them to forget to eat. They experience physical and emotional pain, with bones clinging to flesh and groaning that keeps them awake. The psalmist endures taunting from enemies and faces derision and curses. They feel the weight of God's indignation and anger, perceiving themselves as being taken up and thrown down. The psalmist compares their fleeting days to an evening shadow and withering grass.<br><br>

            However, the psalmist shifts their focus to the enduring nature of the Lord. They affirm God's eternal throne and the everlasting nature of His name. The psalmist declares that it is time for God to have pity on Zion and favor her. They express the deep attachment of God's servants to the city, and how the nations and kings will come to fear the name and glory of the Lord. The psalmist acknowledges God's role in building up Zion and His regard for the prayers of the destitute.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist emphasizes the importance of recording these events for future generations, so that the people yet to be created may praise the Lord. They describe how God looks down from heaven to hear the groans of prisoners and set free those who were doomed to die. The psalmist envisions a time when the name of the Lord will be declared in Zion and His praise in Jerusalem, as peoples and kingdoms gather to worship Him.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist acknowledges their own frailty and pleas for God to spare them in the midst of their days. They acknowledge God as the Creator of the earth and the heavens, affirming that while all things will perish, God will remain unchanged. The psalmist expresses confidence in the future security and establishment of the children of God's servants before Him.<br><br></p>
