        1. Oh sing to the Lord a new song;
        sing to the Lord, all the earth!<br><br>
        2. Sing to the Lord, bless his name;
        tell of his salvation from day to day.<br><br>
        3. Declare his glory among the nations,
        his marvelous works among all the peoples!<br><br>
        4. For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised;
        he is to be feared above all gods.<br><br>
        5. For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols,
        but the Lord made the heavens.<br><br>
        6. Splendor and majesty are before him;
        strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.<br><br>
        
        7. Ascribe to the Lord, O families of the peoples,
        ascribe to the Lord glory and strength!<br><br>
        8. Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;
        bring an offering, and come into his courts!<br><br>
        9. Worship the Lord in the splendor of holiness;
        tremble before him, all the earth!<br><br>
        
        10. Say among the nations, "The Lord reigns!
        Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved;
        he will judge the peoples with equity."<br><br>
        
        11. Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
        let the sea roar, and all that fills it;<br><br>
        12. let the field exult, and everything in it!
        Then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy<br><br>
        13. before the Lord, for he comes,
        for he comes to judge the earth.
        He will judge the world in righteousness,
        and the peoples in his faithfulness.<br><br></p>
