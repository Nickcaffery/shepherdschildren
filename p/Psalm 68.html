        1. Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered;
        let those who hate him flee before him!<br><br>
        2. As smoke is driven away, so you shall drive them away;
        as wax melts before fire,
        so the wicked shall perish before God!<br><br>
        3. But the righteous shall be glad;
        they shall exult before God;
        they shall be jubilant with joy!<br><br>
        
        4. Sing to God, sing praises to his name;
        lift up a song to him who rides through the deserts;
        his name is the Lord;
        exult before him!<br><br>
        5. Father of the fatherless and protector of widows
        is God in his holy habitation.<br><br>
        6. God settles the solitary in a home;
        he leads out the prisoners to prosperity,
        but the rebellious dwell in a parched land.<br><br>
        
        7. O God, when you went out before your people,
        when you marched through the wilderness, Selah<br><br>
        8. the earth quaked, the heavens poured down rain,
        before God, the One of Sinai,
        before God, the God of Israel.<br><br>
        9. Rain in abundance, O God, you shed abroad;
        you restored your inheritance as it languished;<br><br>
        10. your flock found a dwelling in it;
        in your goodness, O God, you provided for the needy.<br><br>
        
        11. The Lord gives the word;
        the women who announce the news are a great host:<br><br>
        12. "The kings of the armies—they flee, they flee!"
        The women at home divide the spoil—<br><br>
        13. though you men lie among the sheepfolds—
        the wings of a dove covered with silver,
        its pinions with shimmering gold.<br><br>
        14. When the Almighty scatters kings there,
        let snow fall on Zalmon.<br><br>
        
        15. O mountain of God, mountain of Bashan;
        O many-peaked mountain, mountain of Bashan!<br><br>
        16. Why do you look with hatred, O many-peaked mountain,
        at the mount that God desired for his abode,
        yes, where the Lord will dwell forever?<br><br>
        17. The chariots of God are twice ten thousand,
        thousands upon thousands;
        the Lord is among them; Sinai is now in the sanctuary.<br><br>
        18. You ascended on high,
        leading a host of captives in your train
        and receiving gifts among men,
        even among the rebellious, that the Lord God may dwell there.<br><br>
        
        19. Blessed be the Lord,
        who daily bears us up;
        God is our salvation. Selah<br><br>
        20. Our God is a God of salvation,
        and to God, the Lord, belong deliverances from death.<br><br>
        
        21. But God will strike the heads of his enemies,
        the hairy crown of him who walks in his guilty ways.<br><br>
        22. The Lord said,
        "I will bring them back from Bashan,<br><br>
        23. that you may strike your feet in their blood,
        that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from the foe."<br><br>
        
        24. Your procession is seen, O God,
        the procession of my God, my King, into the sanctuary—<br><br>
        25. the singers in front, the musicians last,
        between them virgins playing tambourines:<br><br>
        26. "Bless God in the great congregation,
        the Lord, O you who are of Israel's fountain!"<br><br>
        27. There is Benjamin, the least of them, in the lead,
        the princes of Judah in their throng,
        the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.<br><br>
        
        28. Summon your power, O God,
        the power, O God, by which you have worked for us.<br><br>
        29. Because of your temple at Jerusalem
        kings shall bear gifts to you.<br><br>
        30. Rebuke the beasts that dwell among the reeds,
        the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples.
        Trample underfoot those who lust after tribute;
        scatter the peoples who delight in war.<br><br>
        31. Nobles shall come from Egypt;
        Cush shall hasten to stretch out her hands to God.<br><br>
        
        32. O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God;
        sing praises to the Lord, Selah<br><br>
        33. to him who rides in the heavens, the ancient heavens;
        behold, he sends out his voice, his mighty voice.<br><br>
        34. Ascribe power to God,
        whose majesty is over Israel,
        and whose power is in the skies.<br><br>
        35. Awesome is God from his sanctuary;
        the God of Israel—he is the one who gives power and strength to his people.
        Blessed be God!<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 68 is a powerful and exultant psalm that celebrates God's triumph, His care for the vulnerable, and His majestic power. It recounts His deliverance of His people, His rule over creation, and His provision for those in need.</h4>
            The psalm begins with an invocation for God to arise and scatter His enemies, causing those who hate Him to flee. It describes the wicked perishing before God like smoke dissipating and wax melting before fire. In contrast, the righteous are glad and jubilant before God, rejoicing in His presence.<br><br>

            The psalmist calls for singing and praising God's name, acknowledging Him as the One who rides through the deserts. They recognize God as the Father of the fatherless and the protector of widows, emphasizing His care for the vulnerable. God settles the solitary in a home, leads prisoners to prosperity, and ensures the rebellious dwell in a parched land.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist reflects on God's presence and power demonstrated during Israel's wilderness journey. They recall the earth quaking and rain pouring down as God, the One of Sinai and the God of Israel, led His people. They acknowledge God's restoration of His inheritance and provision for the needy.<br><br>
            
            The psalm highlights the impact of God's intervention in battle. The psalmist declares the women who announce the news as a great host, proclaiming the fleeing of enemy kings and the division of the spoil. They depict the scene as men lying among sheepfolds while the wings of a dove are covered with silver and its pinions with shimmering gold. They call for snow to fall on Mount Zalmon as a symbol of victory.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist addresses a mountain, likely symbolic of a proud and resistant people, questioning its hatred toward the mount chosen by God as His dwelling place. They affirm that God's chariots, numbering in the thousands, are among His people, and Sinai is now in the sanctuary. The psalmist celebrates God's ascension on high, leading captives in His train and receiving gifts even from the rebellious, with the purpose of establishing His dwelling place.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist offers blessings to the Lord, acknowledging His daily support and salvation. They declare that God is a God of deliverance from death.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist acknowledges God's judgment upon His enemies and His plan to bring them back from Bashan. They express a vivid depiction of the defeat of the enemy and the consequences of their guilt.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist envisions a grand procession into the sanctuary, with singers, musicians, and virgins playing tambourines, calling on the congregation to bless God. They mention the tribes of Benjamin, Judah, Zebulun, and Naphtali.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist summons God'spower and praises from the kingdoms of the earth. They acknowledge God's authority in the ancient heavens and His mighty voice that goes forth. They ascribe power to God, recognizing His majesty over Israel and His power in the skies. The psalmist proclaims the awesomeness of God from His sanctuary and declares Him as the One who gives power and strength to His people.<br><br></p>    
        <p><h4>Psalm 68 is a majestic psalm that exalts God's power, triumph, and care for His people. It celebrates His deliverance, rule, and provision. The psalm calls for praise and blessings to God, inviting all to acknowledge His sovereignty and give thanks for His mighty acts.</h4></p>
