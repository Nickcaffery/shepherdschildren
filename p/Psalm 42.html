        1. As a deer pants for flowing streams,
        so pants my soul for you, O God.<br><br>
        2. My soul thirsts for God,
        for the living God.
        When shall I come and appear before God?<br><br>
        3. My tears have been my food
        day and night,
        while they say to me all the day long,
        "Where is your God?"<br><br>
        
        4. These things I remember,
        as I pour out my soul:
        how I would go with the throng
        and lead them in procession to the house of God
        with glad shouts and songs of praise,
        a multitude keeping festival.<br><br>
        
        5. Why are you cast down, O my soul,
        and why are you in turmoil within me?
        Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,
        my salvation 6 and my God.<br><br>
        
        6. My soul is cast down within me;
        therefore I remember you
        from the land of Jordan and of Hermon,
        from Mount Mizar.<br><br>
        7. Deep calls to deep
        at the roar of your waterfalls;
        all your breakers and your waves
        have gone over me.<br><br>
        
        8. By day the Lord commands his steadfast love,
        and at night his song is with me,
        a prayer to the God of my life.<br><br>
        9. I say to God, my rock:
        "Why have you forgotten me?
        Why do I go mourning
        because of the oppression of the enemy?"<br><br>
        10. As with a deadly wound in my bones,
        my adversaries taunt me,
        while they say to me all the day long,
        "Where is your God?"<br><br>
        
        11. Why are you cast down, O my soul,
        and why are you in turmoil within me?
        Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,
        my salvation and my God.<br><br></p>
