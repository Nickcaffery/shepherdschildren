      1. Why, O Lord, do you stand far away?
Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?<br><br>

2. In arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the poor;
let them be caught in the schemes that they have devised.<br><br>
3. For the wicked boasts of the desires of his soul,
and the one greedy for gain curses and renounces the Lord.<br><br>
4. In the pride of his face the wicked does not seek him;
all his thoughts are, "There is no God."<br><br>
5. His ways prosper at all times;
your judgments are on high, out of his sight;
as for all his foes, he puffs at them.<br><br>
6. He says in his heart, "I shall not be moved;
throughout all generations I shall not meet adversity."<br><br>

7. His mouth is filled with cursing and deceit and oppression;
under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.<br><br>
8. He sits in ambush in the villages;
in hiding places he murders the innocent.
His eyes stealthily watch for the helpless;<br><br>
9. he lurks in ambush like a lion in his thicket;
he lurks that he may seize the poor;
he seizes the poor when he draws him into his net.<br><br>
10. The helpless are crushed, sink down,
and fall by his might.<br><br>
11. He says in his heart, "God has forgotten,
he has hidden his face, he will never see it."<br><br>

12. Arise, O Lord; O God, lift up your hand;
forget not the afflicted.<br><br>
13. Why does the wicked renounce God
and say in his heart, "You will not call to account"?<br><br>
14. But you do see, for you note mischief and vexation,
that you may take it into your hands;
to you the helpless commits himself;
you have been the helper of the fatherless.<br><br>
15. Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer;
call his wickedness to account till you find none.<br><br>

16. The Lord is king forever and ever;
the nations perish from his land.<br><br>
17. O Lord, you hear the desire of the afflicted;
you will strengthen their heart; you will incline your ear<br><br>
18. to do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed,
so that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 10 is a lament and prayer that addresses the existence of evil and the oppression of the wicked. It expresses the psalmist's cry for God's intervention and justice on behalf of the afflicted and the oppressed.</h4>
            The psalm begins by questioning why God seems distant and hidden in times of trouble. The wicked are described as arrogant and actively pursuing the poor. The psalmist asks that they be caught in their own schemes and be held accountable for their actions. The wicked boast in their desires, curse and renounce the Lord, and deny His existence.<br><br>

            The wicked appear to prosper, while God's judgments may seem out of reach. They exhibit pride and declare that they will never be moved or face adversity. Their mouths are filled with cursing, deceit, oppression, and mischief. They prey upon the helpless, murdering the innocent and seizing the poor.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist laments the crushing and falling of the helpless under the might of the wicked. The wicked, in their hearts, believe that God has forgotten and hidden His face, thinking He will never see their actions.<br><br>
            
            In response, the psalmist calls upon God to arise and lift up His hand, not forgetting the afflicted. The psalmist questions why the wicked renounce God and assume that He will not hold them accountable. The psalmist affirms that God sees the mischief and vexation and commits the helpless into His care.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist asks God to break the arm of the wicked, to call their wickedness to account until it is eradicated. The psalmist acknowledges the eternal kingship of the Lord, declaring that the nations perish from His land.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with confidence in God's responsiveness to the desires of the afflicted. God strengthens their hearts, listens to their cries, and acts justly on behalf of the fatherless and the oppressed. The ultimate hope is that, through God's intervention, humanity will no longer strike terror on the earth.<br><br></p>
