      1. It is good to give thanks to the Lord,
to sing praises to your name, O Most High;<br><br>
2. to declare your steadfast love in the morning,
and your faithfulness by night,<br><br>
3. to the music of the lute and the harp,
to the melody of the lyre.<br><br>
4. For you, O Lord, have made me glad by your work;
at the works of your hands I sing for joy.<br><br>

5. How great are your works, O Lord!
Your thoughts are very deep!<br><br>
6. The stupid man cannot know;
the fool cannot understand this:<br><br>
7. that though the wicked sprout like grass
and all evildoers flourish,
they are doomed to destruction forever;<br><br>

9. For behold, your enemies, O Lord,
for behold, your enemies shall perish;
all evildoers shall be scattered.<br><br>

10. But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox;
you have poured over me fresh oil.<br><br>
11. My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies;
my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants.<br><br>

12. The righteous flourish like the palm tree

13. They are planted in the house of the Lord;
they flourish in the courts of our God.<br><br>
14. They still bear fruit in old age;
they are ever full of sap and green,<br><br>
15. to declare that the Lord is upright;
he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 92 is a psalm of praise and thanksgiving, exalting the greatness and faithfulness of God while contrasting the destiny of the righteous and the wicked.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by declaring the goodness of giving thanks to the Lord and singing praises to His name, the Most High. They emphasize the importance of acknowledging God's steadfast love in the morning and His faithfulness throughout the night. The psalmist calls for music and instruments to accompany the praise and joyous singing to the Lord.<br><br>

            The psalmist marvels at the great works of the Lord, acknowledging the depth of His thoughts. They highlight the inability of the foolish and wicked to understand the ultimate fate of evildoers. Although the wicked may appear to prosper and flourish like grass, they are ultimately doomed to destruction. In contrast, the psalmist recognizes the eternal exaltation of the Lord, who reigns on high forever. The enemies of the Lord will perish, and evildoers will be scattered.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist reflects on their personal experience of God's favor. They describe how God has exalted their position, symbolized by the "horn of the wild ox," and poured fresh oil over them, signifying blessing and anointing. They have witnessed the downfall of their enemies and the defeat of their assailants.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist then describes the flourishing nature of the righteous. They liken the righteous to palm trees and cedars in Lebanon, which grow tall and strong. The righteous are planted in the house of the Lord and flourish in His courts. They continue to bear fruit even in old age, remaining vibrant and full of life. The enduring fruitfulness of the righteous serves as a testimony to the uprightness of the Lord. The psalmist declares that the Lord is their rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.<br><br></p>
