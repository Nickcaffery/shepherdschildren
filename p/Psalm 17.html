        1. Hear a just cause, O Lord; attend to my cry!
        Give ear to my prayer from lips free of deceit!<br><br>
        2. From your presence let my vindication come!
        Let your eyes behold the right!<br><br>
        
        3. You have tried my heart, you have visited me by night,
        you have tested me, and you will find nothing;
        I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress.<br><br>
        4. With regard to the works of man, by the word of your lips
        I have avoided the ways of the violent.<br><br>
        5. My steps have held fast to your paths;
        my feet have not slipped.<br><br>
        
        6. I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God;
        incline your ear to me; hear my words.<br><br>
        7. Wondrously show your steadfast love,
        O Savior of those who seek refuge
        from their adversaries at your right hand.<br><br>
        
        8. Keep me as the apple of your eye;
        hide me in the shadow of your wings,<br><br>
        9. from the wicked who do me violence,
        my deadly enemies who surround me.<br><br>
        
        10. They close their hearts to pity;
        with their mouths they speak arrogantly.<br><br>
        11. They have now surrounded our steps;
        they set their eyes to cast us to the ground.<br><br>
        12. He is like a lion eager to tear,
        as a young lion lurking in ambush.<br><br>
        
        13. Arise, O Lord! Confront him, subdue him!
        Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,<br><br>
        14. from men by your hand, O Lord,
        from men of the world whose portion is in this life.
        You fill their womb with treasure;
        they are satisfied with children,
        and they leave their abundance to their infants.<br><br>
        
        15. As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness;
        when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 17 is a prayer of David, seeking God's deliverance and protection from his enemies. It expresses the psalmist's confidence in God's righteousness and pleads for vindication against those who do him violence.</h4>
            The psalm begins with a plea for God to hear the psalmist's just cause and to attend to his cry. The psalmist desires God's presence and vindication, asking Him to behold what is right.<br><br>

            The psalmist acknowledges that God has tested and visited him, finding nothing deceitful. The psalmist has purposed to keep their mouth from transgressing and has avoided the ways of the violent. They have remained steadfast in following God's paths.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist calls upon God, expecting Him to answer and incline His ear to their words. They plead for God to show His steadfast love and act as the Savior of those who seek refuge from their adversaries.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist asks God to keep them as the apple of His eye and to hide them in the shadow of His wings. They seek protection from the wicked enemies who inflict violence upon them.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist describes the wicked as lacking pity, speaking arrogantly, and surrounding them with harmful intentions. The enemies are likened to a lion eager to tear and a young lion lurking in ambush.<br><br>
            
            In verse 13, the psalmist calls upon the Lord to arise and confront the enemy, subduing them and delivering their soul from the wicked. The psalmist seeks divine intervention and asks for deliverance by God's sword and hand.<br><br>
            
            Verse 14 portrays the worldly men whose portion and satisfaction are found in this life. They accumulate wealth and leave their abundance to their descendants. The psalmist acknowledges the temporal nature of their prosperity.<br><br>
            
            In the final verse, the psalmist expresses their hope and confidence in beholding God's face in righteousness. They anticipate awakening to be satisfied with His likeness, suggesting a longing for communion with God and the ultimate fulfillment of their relationship with Him.<br><br></p>
