        1. Shout for joy to God, all the earth;<br><br>
        2. sing the glory of his name;
        give to him glorious praise!<br><br>
        3. Say to God, "How awesome are your deeds!
        So great is your power that your enemies come cringing to you.<br><br>
        4. All the earth worships you
        and sings praises to you;
        they sing praises to your name." Selah<br><br>
        
        5. Come and see what God has done:
        he is awesome in his deeds toward the children of man.<br><br>
        6. He turned the sea into dry land;
        they passed through the river on foot.
        There did we rejoice in him,<br><br>
        7. who rules by his might forever,
        whose eyes keep watch on the nationsâ€”
        let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah<br><br>
        
        8. Bless our God, O peoples;
        let the sound of his praise be heard,<br><br>
        9. who has kept our soul among the living
        and has not let our feet slip.<br><br>
        10. For you, O God, have tested us;
        you have tried us as silver is tried.<br><br>
        11. You brought us into the net;
        you laid a crushing burden on our backs;<br><br>
        12. you let men ride over our heads;
        we went through fire and through water;
        yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance.<br><br>
        
        13. I will come into your house with burnt offerings;
        I will perform my vows to you,<br><br>
        14. that which my lips uttered
        and my mouth promised when I was in trouble.<br><br>
        15. I will offer to you burnt offerings of fattened animals,
        with the smoke of the sacrifice of rams;
        I will make an offering of bulls and goats. Selah<br><br>
        
        16. Come and hear, all you who fear God,<br><br>
        17. I cried to him with my mouth,
        and high praise was on my tongue.<br><br>
        18. If I had cherished iniquity in my heart,
        the Lord would not have listened.<br><br>
        19. But truly God has listened;
        he has attended to the voice of my prayer.<br><br>
        
        20. Blessed be God,
        because he has not rejected my prayer
        or removed his steadfast love from me!<br><br></p>
