        1. God is our refuge and strength,
        a very present help in trouble.<br><br>
        2. Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way,
        though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea,<br><br>
        3. though its waters roar and foam,
        though the mountains tremble at its swelling. Selah<br><br>
        
        4. There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,
        the holy habitation of the Most High.<br><br>
        5. God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved;
        God will help her when morning dawns.<br><br>
        6. The nations rage, the kingdoms totter;
        he utters his voice, the earth melts.<br><br>
        7. The Lord of hosts is with us;
        the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah<br><br>
        
        8. Come, behold the works of the Lord,
        how he has brought desolations on the earth.<br><br>
        9. He makes wars cease to the end of the earth;
        he breaks the bow and shatters the spear;
        he burns the chariots with fire.<br><br>
        10. "Be still, and know that I am God.
        I will be exalted among the nations,
        I will be exalted in the earth!"<br><br>
        11. The Lord of hosts is with us;
        the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 46 is a powerful declaration of God's presence, power, and protection. It begins by acknowledging God as the refuge and strength of His people, a very present help in times of trouble. The psalmist declares their trust in God, even in the face of catastrophic events such as the earth giving way and mountains being moved into the sea. Despite the chaos and turmoil around them, they find security in God.</h4>
            The psalmist describes a river that brings joy to the city of God, the holy habitation of the Most High. They affirm that God is in their midst, ensuring the city's stability and providing help at the break of dawn. As the nations rage and kingdoms falter, God speaks and the earth melts. The psalmist asserts that the Lord of hosts is with them, and the God of Jacob is their fortress.<br><br>

            The psalmist invites the reader to witness the works of the Lord, acknowledging His power in bringing desolation upon the earth. They affirm that God is the one who brings an end to wars, breaking weapons of war and destroying chariots. The psalmist then delivers a powerful message from God, urging stillness and recognition of His divine nature. God declares that He will be exalted among the nations and throughout the earth.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a reaffirmation that the Lord of hosts is with them, and the God of Jacob is their fortress. It echoes the earlier declaration of trust and serves as a reminder of God's constant presence and protection.<br><br></p>
