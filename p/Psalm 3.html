Save me, O my God!

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 3 is attributed to King David and is believed to have been written during a time of distress and conflict. It expresses David's trust in God's deliverance and salvation amidst his enemies' opposition.</h4>
            The psalm begins with David acknowledging the multitude of his foes and the rising opposition against him. People are questioning the possibility of his salvation, casting doubt on God's ability to rescue him.<br><br>

            However, David immediately turns his attention to God and declares Him as his shield, glory, and the one who lifts up his head. Despite the challenging circumstances, David finds refuge and confidence in the Lord's protection. He cries out to God, and he receives an answer from His holy hill.<br><br>
            
            David expresses his unwavering trust in God's provision and care. He testifies that he laid down and slept peacefully because the Lord sustained him. Even in the face of numerous adversaries, David declares that he will not be afraid, for God is with him.<br><br>
            
            In verse 7, David calls upon the Lord to arise and save him. He looks to God as the one who will strike down his enemies and bring justice. David relies on God's power to defeat those who oppose him.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a statement of assurance and praise. David affirms that salvation belongs to the Lord, acknowledging His sovereignty and the ultimate source of deliverance. He implores God to bless His people, and the psalm ends with a musical interlude denoted by the word "Selah," inviting reflection on the words that have been spoken.<br><br></p>    
        <p><h4>Psalm 3 portrays a steadfast trust in God's protection and salvation, even in the midst of adversity. It serves as a source of encouragement for believers, reminding them to turn to God in times of trouble and rely on His strength and deliverance.</h4></p>
