        1. To you I lift up my eyes,
        O you who are enthroned in the heavens!<br><br>
        2. Behold, as the eyes of servants
        look to the hand of their master,
        as the eyes of a maidservant
        to the hand of her mistress,
        so our eyes look to the Lord our God,
        till he has mercy upon us.<br><br>
        
        3. Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us,
        for we have had more than enough of contempt.<br><br>
        4. Our soul has had more than enough
        of the scorn of those who are at ease,
        of the contempt of the proud.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 123 is a psalm of supplication and humble dependence on the Lord. The psalmist lifts their eyes to the Lord, acknowledging His exalted position in the heavens. They compare their posture before the Lord to that of servants who look to the hand of their master or a maidservant who looks to the hand of her mistress.</h4>
            The psalmist expresses their unwavering focus and reliance on the Lord. Just as the eyes of servants are fixed on their master's hand for guidance and provision, the psalmist's eyes are fixed on the Lord their God until He shows them mercy. The psalmist recognizes their need for the Lord's intervention and appeals to His compassion and grace.<br><br>

            The psalmist pleads for the Lord's mercy, recognizing the contempt and scorn they have experienced. They acknowledge that they have had more than enough of the contempt of others, particularly those who are at ease and the proud. The psalmist seeks the Lord's intervention and deliverance from the oppressive treatment they have endured.<br><br></p>
