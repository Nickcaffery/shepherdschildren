        1. Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man?
        The steadfast love of God endures all the day.<br><br>
        2. Your tongue plots destruction,
        like a sharp razor, you worker of deceit.<br><br>
        3. You love evil more than good,
        and lying more than speaking what is right. Selah<br><br>
        
        4. You love all words that devour,
        O deceitful tongue.<br><br>
        5. But God will break you down forever;
        he will snatch and tear you from your tent;
        he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah<br><br>
        
        6. The righteous shall see and fear,
        and shall laugh at him, saying,<br><br>
        7. "See the man who would not make God his refuge,
        but trusted in the abundance of his riches
        and sought refuge in his own destruction!"<br><br>
        
        8. But I am like a green olive tree
        in the house of God.
        I trust in the steadfast love of God
        forever and ever.<br><br>
        9. I will thank you forever,
        because you have done it.
        I will wait for your name, for it is good,
        in the presence of the godly.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 52 is a psalm of David that addresses the arrogance and wickedness of a particular individual, often believed to be Doeg the Edomite, who betrayed David to King Saul. The psalm contrasts the downfall of the evildoer with the faith and trust of the righteous in God.</h4>
            David begins by questioning why the mighty man boasts of his evil actions and emphasizes that the steadfast love of God endures throughout the day. He describes the deceitful nature of the evildoer's tongue, plotting destruction and loving evil more than good.<br><br>

            David continues to condemn the evildoer, highlighting their delight in devouring words and deceptive speech. However, he assures that God will ultimately bring judgment upon the wicked, breaking them down and uprooting them from their place of security.<br><br>
            
            In contrast, the righteous will witness the downfall of the wicked and be filled with both fear and laughter. They will marvel at the arrogance of the one who did not make God their refuge but instead trusted in their wealth and brought about their own destruction.<br><br>
            
            David affirms his own faith and trust in God, comparing himself to a green olive tree in the house of God. He relies on the steadfast love of God forever and expresses gratitude for what God has done. He resolves to wait for God's name, acknowledging its goodness, in the presence of the godly.<br><br></p>
