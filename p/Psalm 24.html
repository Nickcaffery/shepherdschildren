      1. The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof,
the world and those who dwell therein,<br><br>

3. Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord?
And who shall stand in his holy place?<br><br>
4. He who has clean hands and a pure heart,
who does not lift up his soul to what is false

5. He will receive blessing from the Lord
and righteousness from the God of his salvation.<br><br>
6. Such is the generation of those who seek him,
who seek the face of the God of Jacob. Selah<br><br>

7. Lift up your heads, O gates!
And be lifted up, O ancient doors,
that the King of glory may come in.<br><br>
8. Who is this King of glory?
The Lord, strong and mighty,
the Lord, mighty in battle!<br><br>
9. Lift up your heads, O gates!
And lift them up, O ancient doors,
that the King of glory may come in.<br><br>
10. Who is this King of glory?
The Lord of hosts,
he is the King of glory! Selah<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 24 is a hymn that celebrates the sovereignty and kingship of God. It reflects on the majesty of God as the creator of the earth and focuses on the requirements for approaching His holy presence. The psalm concludes with a call for the gates to be lifted up, welcoming the King of glory.</h4>
          The psalm begins by declaring that the earth and everything in it belongs to the Lord. He is the creator who established the earth upon the seas and rivers. This acknowledgment sets the stage for the psalm's central theme of God's kingship and authority.<br><br>

          Verses 3 to 6 address the question of who is worthy to enter the presence of the Lord. It highlights the moral and spiritual qualities required to approach His holy hill. The one who may ascend the hill of the Lord and stand in His holy place is described as having clean hands, a pure heart, and a genuine devotion to God. They do not engage in falsehood or deceit but seek righteousness and the face of the God of Jacob. The psalmist identifies this as the generation of those who sincerely seek God.<br><br>
          
          In verses 7 to 10, the psalm takes a dramatic turn, addressing the gates and ancient doors, urging them to lift up their heads to welcome the King of glory. The question is raised: Who is this King of glory? The answer is given twice, emphasizing the might and strength of the Lord. He is the King of glory, the Lord who is strong, mighty in battle, and the Lord of hosts (the Lord of armies).<br><br>
          
          The psalm concludes with the word "Selah," indicating a pause for reflection and contemplation.<br><br></p>
