        1. I will bless the Lord at all times;
        his praise shall continually be in my mouth.<br><br>
        2. My soul makes its boast in the Lord;
        let the humble hear and be glad.<br><br>
        3. Oh, magnify the Lord with me,
        and let us exalt his name together!<br><br>
        
        4. I sought the Lord, and he answered me
        and delivered me from all my fears.<br><br>
        5. Those who look to him are radiant,
        and their faces shall never be ashamed.<br><br>
        6. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him
        and saved him out of all his troubles.<br><br>
        7. The angel of the Lord encamps
        around those who fear him, and delivers them.<br><br>
        
        8. Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good!
        Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him!<br><br>
        9. Oh, fear the Lord, you his saints,
        for those who fear him have no lack!<br><br>
        10. The young lions suffer want and hunger;
        but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.<br><br>
        
        11. Come, O children, listen to me;
        I will teach you the fear of the Lord.<br><br>
        12. What man is there who desires life
        and loves many days, that he may see good?<br><br>
        13. Keep your tongue from evil
        and your lips from speaking deceit.<br><br>
        14. Turn away from evil and do good;
        seek peace and pursue it.<br><br>
        
        15. The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous
        and his ears toward their cry.<br><br>
        16. The face of the Lord is against those who do evil,
        to cut off the memory of them from the earth.<br><br>
        17. When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears
        and delivers them out of all their troubles.<br><br>
        18. The Lord is near to the brokenhearted
        and saves the crushed in spirit.<br><br>
        
        19. Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
        but the Lord delivers him out of them all.<br><br>
        20. He keeps all his bones;
        not one of them is broken.<br><br>
        21. Affliction will slay the wicked,
        and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.<br><br>
        22. The Lord redeems the life of his servants;
        none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 34 is a psalm of praise, trust, and instruction. It emphasizes the goodness and faithfulness of the Lord, His deliverance of the righteous, and His care for those who fear Him.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by expressing their intention to bless the Lord at all times and continually have His praise on their lips. They boast in the Lord and invite the humble to hear and be glad. They call upon others to magnify and exalt the Lord's name together.<br><br>

            The psalmist testifies to seeking the Lord and being answered and delivered from all their fears. Those who look to the Lord are radiant and will never be ashamed. The psalmist, as a poor man, cried out to the Lord, and He heard and saved them from all troubles. The psalmist asserts that the angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him, delivering them.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist invites others to taste and see that the Lord is good, proclaiming blessings on those who take refuge in Him. They call upon the saints to fear the Lord, assuring them that they will lack no good thing. They contrast this with the suffering and want of young lions, highlighting the provision and abundance found in seeking the Lord.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist shifts to instruction, calling the children to listen and learn the fear of the Lord. They describe the desire for a long and fulfilling life, urging the avoidance of evil and deceitful speech and the pursuit of good, peace, and righteousness.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist emphasizes the watchful care of the Lord toward the righteous. His eyes are on them, His ears are attentive to their cry, and His face is against evildoers. When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears and delivers them from all troubles. He is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist acknowledges that the righteous may face afflictions, but the Lord will deliver them from them all. The Lord keeps their bones intact, while affliction will slay the wicked. Those who hate the righteous will be condemned. The psalmist declares that the Lord redeems the lives of His servants, and none who take refuge in Him will be condemned.<br><br></p>
