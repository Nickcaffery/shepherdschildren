        1. Truly God is good to Israel,
        to those who are pure in heart.<br><br>
        2. But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled,
        my steps had nearly slipped.<br><br>
        3. For I was envious of the arrogant
        when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.<br><br>
        
        4. For they have no pangs until death;
        their bodies are fat and sleek.<br><br>
        5. They are not in trouble as others are;
        they are not stricken like the rest of mankind.<br><br>
        6. Therefore pride is their necklace;
        violence covers them as a garment.<br><br>
        7. Their eyes swell out through fatness;
        their hearts overflow with follies.<br><br>
        8. They scoff and speak with malice;
        loftily they threaten oppression.<br><br>
        9. They set their mouths against the heavens,
        and their tongue struts through the earth.<br><br>
        10. Therefore his people turn back to them,
        and find no fault in them.<br><br>
        11. And they say, "How can God know?
        Is there knowledge in the Most High?"<br><br>
        12. Behold, these are the wicked;
        always at ease, they increase in riches.<br><br>
        
        13. All in vain have I kept my heart clean
        and washed my hands in innocence.<br><br>
        14. For all the day long I have been stricken
        and rebuked every morning.<br><br>
        15. If I had said, "I will speak thus,"
        I would have betrayed the generation of your children.<br><br>
        
        16. But when I thought how to understand this,
        it seemed to me a wearisome task,<br><br>
        17. until I went into the sanctuary of God;
        then I discerned their end.<br><br>
        
        18. Truly you set them in slippery places;
        you make them fall to ruin.<br><br>
        19. How they are destroyed in a moment,
        swept away utterly by terrors!<br><br>
        20. Like a dream when one awakes,
        O Lord, when you rouse yourself,
        you despise them as phantoms.<br><br>
        
        21. When my soul was embittered,
        when I was pricked in heart,<br><br>
        22. I was brutish and ignorant;
        I was like a beast toward you.<br><br>
        
        23. Nevertheless, I am continually with you;
        you hold my right hand.<br><br>
        24. You guide me with your counsel,
        and afterward you will receive me to glory.<br><br>
        25. Whom have I in heaven but you?
        And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.<br><br>
        26. My flesh and my heart may fail,
        but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.<br><br>
        
        27. For behold, those who are far from you shall perish;
        you put an end to everyone who is unfaithful to you.<br><br>
        28. But for me it is good to be near God;
        I have made the Lord God my refuge,
        that I may tell of all your works.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 73 is a contemplation on the apparent prosperity of the wicked and the resulting struggle of the psalmist's faith. It explores the inner turmoil and ultimate resolution, finding solace in God's presence and eternal rewards.</h4>
            The psalm begins by affirming that God is good to those who are pure in heart. However, the psalmist confesses their own struggle, almost stumbling and slipping, because they became envious of the arrogant and the prosperity of the wicked. The psalmist observes how the wicked seem to thrive and have no troubles, with fat and sleek bodies. They engage in pride, violence, and folly, speaking with malice and oppressing others. The wicked even question whether God is aware of their actions.<br><br>

            The psalmist becomes disheartened and feels that their own pursuit of righteousness has been in vain. They express feelings of affliction and rebuke, and they consider speaking as the wicked do, which would betray the next generation.<br><br>
            
            However, the psalmist's perspective changes when they enter the sanctuary of God. It is there that they gain insight and discernment regarding the destiny of the wicked. They realize that God sets them on slippery ground, leading to their ultimate ruin and destruction. The wicked are swept away suddenly and become like phantoms in the eyes of God.<br><br>
            
            As the psalmist reflects on this, their bitterness and confusion dissipate. They acknowledge their own foolishness and ignorance in being envious of the wicked. They realize that God is continually with them, holding their right hand, guiding them with His counsel, and promising to receive them into glory. The psalmist recognizes that nothing in heaven or on earth compares to God. Even if their flesh and heart fail, God remains their strength and eternal portion.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with the psalmist recognizing the fate of those who are far from God and unfaithful, acknowledging that they will perish. But for the psalmist, it is good to be near God. They have found refuge in the Lord and commit themselves to proclaiming His works.<br><br></p>
