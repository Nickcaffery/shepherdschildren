        1. Lord, you were favorable to your land;
        you restored the fortunes of Jacob.<br><br>
        2. You forgave the iniquity of your people;
        you covered all their sin. Selah<br><br>
        3. You withdrew all your wrath;
        you turned from your hot anger.<br><br>
        
        4. Restore us again, O God of our salvation,
        and put away your indignation toward us!<br><br>
        5. Will you be angry with us forever?
        Will you prolong your anger to all generations?<br><br>
        6. Will you not revive us again,
        that your people may rejoice in you?<br><br>
        7. Show us your steadfast love, O Lord,
        and grant us your salvation.<br><br>
        
        8. Let me hear what God the Lord will speak,
        for he will speak peace to his people,
        to his saints;
        but let them not turn back to folly.<br><br>
        9. Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him,
        that glory may dwell in our land.<br><br>
        
        10. Steadfast love and faithfulness meet;
        righteousness and peace kiss each other.<br><br>
        11. Faithfulness springs up from the ground,
        and righteousness looks down from the sky.<br><br>
        12. Yes, the Lord will give what is good,
        and our land will yield its increase.<br><br>
        13. Righteousness will go before him
        and make his footsteps a way.<br><br></p>
