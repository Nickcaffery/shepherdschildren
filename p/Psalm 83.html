        1. O God, do not keep silence;
        do not hold your peace or be still, O God!<br><br>
        2. For behold, your enemies make an uproar;
        those who hate you have raised their heads.<br><br>
        3. They lay crafty plans against your people;
        they consult together against your treasured ones.<br><br>
        4. They say, "Come, let us wipe them out as a nation;
        let the name of Israel be remembered no more!"<br><br>
        
        5. For they conspire with one accord;
        against you they make a covenantâ€”<br><br>
        6. the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
        Moab and the Hagrites,<br><br>
        7. Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
        Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;<br><br>
        8. Asshur also has joined them;
        they are the strong arm of the children of Lot. Selah<br><br>
        
        9. Do to them as you did to Midian,
        as to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon,<br><br>
        10. who were destroyed at En-dor,
        who became dung for the ground.<br><br>
        11. Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
        all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,<br><br>
        12. who said, "Let us take possession for ourselves
        of the pastures of God."<br><br>
        
        13. O my God, make them like whirling dust,
        like chaff before the wind.<br><br>
        14. As fire consumes the forest,
        as the flame sets the mountains ablaze,<br><br>
        15. so may you pursue them with your tempest
        and terrify them with your hurricane!<br><br>
        16. Fill their faces with shame,
        that they may seek your name, O Lord.<br><br>
        17. Let them be put to shame and dismayed forever;
        let them perish in disgrace,<br><br>
        18. that they may know that you alone,
        whose name is the Lord,
        are the Most High over all the earth.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 83 is a plea to God for deliverance from enemies who seek to destroy Israel. The psalmist appeals to God not to remain silent but to take action against those who hate Him and plot against His people.</h4>
            The psalmist describes how the enemies of Israel have gathered together and formed a covenant against God. They list various nations and tribes that have conspired together, including Edom, Ishmaelites, Moab, Hagrites, Gebal, Ammon, Amalek, Philistia, Tyre, and Asshur. These nations are portrayed as a strong coalition, the strong arm of the descendants of Lot.<br><br>

            The psalmist calls upon God to deal with these enemies as He did with past oppressors. They refer to God's deliverance of Israel from Midian, Sisera, Jabin, and others who were defeated and destroyed. The psalmist asks God to make the enemies of Israel like whirling dust or chaff before the wind, easily scattered and dispersed. They invoke imagery of fire consuming a forest and a flame setting mountains ablaze, depicting the complete destruction of their enemies.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist prays for God to pursue the enemies with His tempest and terrify them with His hurricane-like power. They desire that the faces of the enemies be filled with shame, leading them to seek God's name and acknowledge His sovereignty. The psalmist requests that the enemies be put to everlasting shame and dismay, perishing in disgrace. The ultimate purpose is that they may come to recognize that God alone, whose name is the Lord, is the Most High over all the earth.<br><br></p>
