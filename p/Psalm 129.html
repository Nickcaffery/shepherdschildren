        <p><h4>Psalm 129 is a psalm of lament that recounts the afflictions and persecutions endured by Israel, yet expresses confidence in the Lord's deliverance and righteousness. It calls for the shame and defeat of those who hate Zion and affirms God's justice.</h4>
            The psalm begins by declaring the afflictions that Israel has endured from their youth. It acknowledges the persistent affliction and opposition faced by the nation throughout its history. Despite the afflictions, Israel affirms that their enemies have not been able to overcome them.<br><br>

            The psalmist uses the imagery of plowers who have plowed upon their back, creating long furrows. This imagery depicts the severe and painful oppression and mistreatment endured by Israel.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist proclaims the righteousness of the Lord, acknowledging His faithfulness and justice. They declare that the Lord has cut the cords of the wicked, symbolizing the severing of the power and influence of those who oppress and afflict Israel.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a prayer for the shame and defeat of those who hate Zion, referring to those who are hostile to the people and the city of Jerusalem. The psalmist desires their turning backward, signifying their failure and retreat. They use the imagery of grass on housetops that withers before it can grow, depicting the short-lived nature of the enemies' plans and ambitions.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist expresses that the enemies' efforts will not yield fruitful results. They will not be able to reap a harvest or receive blessings. The psalmist desires that those who pass by the enemies will not offer them the blessing of the Lord but instead pronounce their own blessing in the name of the Lord.<br><br></p>
