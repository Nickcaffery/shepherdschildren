        1. The fool says in his heart, "There is no God."
        They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds;
        there is none who does good.<br><br>
        
        2. The Lord looks down from heaven on the children of man,
        to see if there are any who understand,
        who seek after God.<br><br>
        
        3. They have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt;
        there is none who does good,
        not even one.<br><br>
        
        4. Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers
        who eat up my people as they eat bread
        and do not call upon the Lord?<br><br>
        
        5. There they are in great terror,
        for God is with the generation of the righteous.<br><br>
        6. You would shame the plans of the poor,
        but the Lord is his refuge.<br><br>
        
        7. Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion!
        When the Lord restores the fortunes of his people,
        let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 14 is a psalm that addresses the folly of those who deny the existence of God and engage in wickedness. It highlights the corruption and moral decline among humanity, while expressing hope for the salvation and restoration of God's people.</h4>
            The psalm begins by describing the fool who denies the existence of God. Such individuals are portrayed as corrupt, engaging in abominable deeds, and lacking any sense of moral goodness. The psalmist emphasizes the folly of their denial and wickedness.<br><br>

            In verse 2, the psalm shifts to the perspective of the Lord, who looks down from heaven upon humanity. God observes to see if there are any who understand and seek after Him. The psalm implies that the majority of people have turned aside and become corrupt, devoid of any true goodness.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist questions the knowledge and understanding of evildoers who devour God's people without remorse and fail to call upon the Lord. It highlights the unjust treatment and persecution experienced by the righteous.<br><br>
            
            In verse 5, the evildoers are depicted in great terror because God is with the generation of the righteous. This contrasts their fear with the security and refuge found in the Lord.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist addresses the plight of the poor and how their plans are shamed by the evildoers. However, the psalm affirms that the Lord serves as a refuge for the poor, providing them with protection and hope.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a prayer for the salvation and restoration of Israel, expressing the longing for deliverance to come from Zion. The psalmist anticipates the time when the Lord will restore the fortunes of His people, resulting in rejoicing and gladness for Jacob (Israel)<br><br>.</p>
