        1. O Lord, in your strength the king rejoices,
        and in your salvation how greatly he exults!<br><br>
        2. You have given him his heart's desire
        and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah<br><br>
        
        3. For you meet him with rich blessings;
        you set a crown of fine gold upon his head.<br><br>
        4. He asked life of you; you gave it to him,
        length of days forever and ever.<br><br>
        5. His glory is great through your salvation;
        splendor and majesty you bestow on him.<br><br>
        6. For you make him most blessed forever;
        you make him glad with the joy of your presence.<br><br>
        7. For the king trusts in the Lord,
        and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be moved.<br><br>
        
        8. Your hand will find out all your enemies;
        your right hand will find out those who hate you.<br><br>
        9. You will make them as a blazing oven
        when you appear.
        The Lord will swallow them up in his wrath,
        and fire will consume them.<br><br>
        10. You will destroy their descendants from the earth,
        and their offspring from among the children of man.<br><br>
        11. Though they plan evil against you,
        though they devise mischief, they will not succeed.<br><br>
        12. For you will put them to flight;
        you will aim at their faces with your bows.<br><br>
        
        13. Be exalted, O Lord, in your strength!
        We will sing and praise your power.<br><br></p>
