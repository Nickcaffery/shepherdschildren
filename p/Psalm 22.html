        1. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
        Why are you so far from saving me, from the words of my groaning?<br><br>
        2. O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer,
        and by night, but I find no rest.<br><br>
        
        3. Yet you are holy,
        enthroned on the praises of Israel.<br><br>
        4. In you our fathers trusted;
        they trusted, and you delivered them.<br><br>
        5. To you they cried and were rescued;
        in you they trusted and were not put to shame.<br><br>
        
        6. But I am a worm and not a man,
        scorned by mankind and despised by the people.<br><br>
        7. All who see me mock me;
        they make mouths at me; they wag their heads;<br><br>
        8. "He trusts in the Lord; let him deliver him;
        let him rescue him, for he delights in him!"<br><br>
        
        9. Yet you are he who took me from the womb;
        you made me trust you at my mother's breasts.<br><br>
        10. On you was I cast from my birth,
        and from my mother's womb you have been my God.<br><br>
        11. Be not far from me,
        for trouble is near,
        and there is none to help.<br><br>
        
        12. Many bulls encompass me;
        strong bulls of Bashan surround me;<br><br>
        13. they open wide their mouths at me,
        like a ravening and roaring lion.<br><br>
        
        14. I am poured out like water,
        and all my bones are out of joint;
        my heart is like wax;
        it is melted within my breast;<br><br>
        15. my strength is dried up like a potsherd,
        and my tongue sticks to my jaws;
        you lay me in the dust of death.<br><br>
        
        16. For dogs encompass me;
        a company of evildoers encircles me;
        they have pierced my hands and feet—<br><br>
        17. I can count all my bones—
        they stare and gloat over me;<br><br>
        18. they divide my garments among them,
        and for my clothing they cast lots.<br><br>
        
        19. But you, O Lord, do not be far off!
        O you my help, come quickly to my aid!<br><br>
        20. Deliver my soul from the sword,
        my precious life from the power of the dog!<br><br>
        21. Save me from the mouth of the lion!<br><br>
        
        22. I will tell of your name to my brothers;
        in the midst of the congregation I will praise you:<br><br>
        23. You who fear the Lord, praise him!
        All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him,
        and stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel!<br><br>
        24. For he has not despised or abhorred
        the affliction of the afflicted,
        and he has not hidden his face from him,
        but has heard, when he cried to him.<br><br>
        
        25. From you comes my praise in the great congregation;
        my vows I will perform before those who fear him.<br><br>
        26. The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied;
        those who seek him shall praise the Lord!
        May your hearts live forever!<br><br>
        
        27. All the ends of the earth shall remember
        and turn to the Lord,
        and all the families of the nations
        shall worship before you.<br><br>
        28. For kingship belongs to the Lord,
        and he rules over the nations.<br><br>
        
        29. All the prosperous of the earth eat and worship;
        before him shall bow all who go down to the dust,
        even the one who could not keep himself alive.<br><br>
        30. Posterity shall serve him;
        it shall be told of the Lord to the coming generation;<br><br>
        31. they shall come and proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn,
        that he has done it.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 22 is a deeply emotional and prophetic psalm attributed to David. It begins with a cry of anguish and feeling forsaken by God, echoing the words of Jesus on the cross. It then transitions to a declaration of trust in God and an expression of suffering and persecution. The psalm ultimately ends with a note of hope and praise, proclaiming God's faithfulness and the ultimate victory of His righteous purpose.</h4>
            The psalm begins with the famous words, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" This expression of deep anguish is followed by the psalmist's plea for God's attention and deliverance.<br><br>

            Despite feeling forsaken, the psalmist acknowledges God's holiness and faithfulness to the people of Israel throughout history. They reflect on how their ancestors trusted in God and were delivered, calling upon Him for rescue. The psalmist contrasts this with their own experience of being scorned, mocked, and surrounded by enemies who taunt them for their trust in God.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist recounts their personal relationship with God from birth, expressing a longing for His nearness and help in their time of trouble. They vividly describe their distress, feeling overwhelmed and weakened, as if their bones are out of joint and their strength has dried up.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist speaks of being encircled by enemies who have pierced their hands and feet, as well as the humiliation of having their garments divided among their assailants. These verses carry prophetic echoes that find fulfillment in the suffering and crucifixion of Jesus Christ.<br><br>
            
            Despite their suffering, the psalmist appeals to God for deliverance and salvation. They express confidence in God's ability to rescue them from their adversaries, pleading for His intervention.<br><br>
            
            In verses 22 to 31, the tone shifts to praise and proclamation. The psalmist declares their intention to proclaim God's name and praise Him among their brothers and in the congregation. They call upon all who fear the Lord to glorify and stand in awe of Him. The psalmist affirms God's attentiveness to the cries of the afflicted and vows to perform their vows and praises before those who fear Him.<br><br>
            
            The psalm expands to a vision of the future where all the ends of the earth and the families of the nations turn to the Lord and worship Him. Kingship belongs tothe Lord, and He rules over the nations. The prosperous and those who have passed away will bow before Him, and future generations will serve and proclaim His righteousness.<br><br>
            
            Psalm 22 concludes by acknowledging that God has accomplished His purpose and done what He set out to do. The psalm ends with a declaration of the psalmist's confidence in God's faithfulness, calling for praise and the proclamation of His righteousness to future generations.<br><br></p>
