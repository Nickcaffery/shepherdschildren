        1. The heavens declare the glory of God,
        and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.<br><br>
        2. Day to day pours out speech,
        and night to night reveals knowledge.<br><br>
        3. There is no speech, nor are there words,
        whose voice is not heard.<br><br>
        4. Their voice goes out through all the earth,
        and their words to the end of the world.
        and its circuit to the end of them,
        and there is nothing hidden from its heat.<br><br>
        5. It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course.<br><br>
        6. It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is deprived of its warmth.<br><br>
        7. The law of the Lord is perfect,
        reviving the soul;
        the testimony of the Lord is sure,
        making wise the simple;<br><br>
        8. the precepts of the Lord are right,
        rejoicing the heart;
        the commandment of the Lord is pure,
        enlightening the eyes;<br><br>
        9. the fear of the Lord is clean,
        enduring forever;
        the rules of the Lord are true,
        and righteous altogether.<br><br>
        10. More to be desired are they than gold,
        even much fine gold;
        sweeter also than honey
        and drippings of the honeycomb.<br><br>
        11. Moreover, by them is your servant warned;
        in keeping them there is great reward.<br><br>
        
        12. Who can discern his errors?
        Declare me innocent from hidden faults.<br><br>
        13. Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins;
        let them not have dominion over me!
        Then I shall be blameless,
        and innocent of great transgression.<br><br>
        
        14. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
        be acceptable in your sight,
        O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 19 is a poetic reflection on the majesty of God's creation and the beauty of His Law. It emphasizes the divine revelation found in both nature and Scripture and ends with a prayer for purity of heart and speech.</h4>
            The psalm begins by describing how the heavens and the sky declare the glory and handiwork of God. Day and night continually testify to His greatness and reveal knowledge without using words. Their message goes out to all the earth and reaches the ends of the world. The psalmist highlights the universal and unspoken testimony of God's creation.<br><br>

            In verse 7, the focus shifts to the law of the Lord. The psalmist praises the perfection, trustworthiness, rightness, purity, and enduring nature of God's law. The law is seen as a source of revival for the soul, wisdom for the simple, joy for the heart, enlightenment for the eyes, and enduring righteousness. The psalmist expresses the surpassing value of God's law, likening it to gold and honey, and recognizes the rewards that come from keeping it.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist acknowledges their human limitations and asks God to reveal any hidden faults and declare them innocent. They also seek God's protection from presumptuous sins, praying that these sins would not have dominion over them. The desire is to be blameless and innocent before God.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a prayer regarding the words of the psalmist's mouth and the meditations of their heart. The psalmist seeks for their thoughts and speech to be pleasing to God, recognizing Him as their rock and redeemer.<br><br></p>
