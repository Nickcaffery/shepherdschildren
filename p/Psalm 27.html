      1. The Lord is my light and my salvation;
whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the stronghold of my life;
of whom shall I be afraid?<br><br>

2. When evildoers assail me
to eat up my flesh,
my adversaries and foes,
it is they who stumble and fall.<br><br>

3. Though an army encamp against me,
my heart shall not fear;
though war arise against me,
yet I will be confident.<br><br>

4. One thing have I asked of the Lord,
that will I seek after:
all the days of my life,
to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord
and to inquire in his temple.<br><br>

5. For he will hide me in his shelter
in the day of trouble;
he will conceal me under the cover of his tent;
he will lift me high upon a rock.<br><br>

6. And now my head shall be lifted up
above my enemies all around me,
and I will offer in his tent
sacrifices with shouts of joy;
I will sing and make melody to the Lord.<br><br>

7. Hear, O Lord, when I cry aloud;
be gracious to me and answer me!<br><br>
8. You have said, "Seek my face."
My heart says to you,
"Your face, Lord, do I seek."<br><br>
9. Hide not your face from me.
Turn not your servant away in anger,
O you who have been my help.
Cast me not off; forsake me not,
O God of my salvation!<br><br>
10. For my father and my mother have forsaken me,
but the Lord will take me in.<br><br>

11. Teach me your way, O Lord,
and lead me on a level path
because of my enemies.<br><br>
12. Give me not up to the will of my adversaries;
for false witnesses have risen against me,
and they breathe out violence.<br><br>

13. I believe that I shall look upon the goodness of the Lord
in the land of the living!<br><br>
14. Wait for the Lord;
be strong, and let your heart take courage;
wait for the Lord!<br><br></p>
