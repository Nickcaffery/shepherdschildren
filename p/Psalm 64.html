        <p><h4>Psalm 64 is a prayer of David, expressing his plea for protection from the schemes and evil words of the wicked. It portrays God's intervention and the ultimate downfall of the evildoers.</h4>
            David begins by calling upon God to hear his voice and preserve his life from the dread caused by his enemies. He seeks refuge from the secret plots and throng of evildoers who sharpen their tongues like swords and shoot bitter words like arrows. These wicked individuals lie in ambush, targeting the blameless suddenly and without fear. They hold fast to their evil purposes and discuss laying snares secretly, thinking that no one can see them. David acknowledges the depth of their wickedness, as they diligently search out injustice.<br><br>

            However, David expresses confidence in God's justice. He declares that God shoots His arrow at the evildoers, causing them to be wounded suddenly. They are brought to ruin, and their own tongues turn against them. Those who witness their downfall wag their heads in judgment and astonishment. David emphasizes that all of mankind fears and acknowledges the works of God.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with an exhortation for the righteous to rejoice in the Lord and take refuge in Him. David encourages the upright in heart to exult and find joy in God's protection and deliverance.<br><br></p>
