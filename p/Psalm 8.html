1. O Lord, our Lord,

to still the enemy and the avenger.<br><br>

the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,<br><br>
4. what is man that you are mindful of him,
and the son of man that you care for him?<br><br>

5. Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings
and crowned him with glory and honor.<br><br>
6. You have given him dominion over the works of your hands;
you have put all things under his feet,<br><br>
7. all sheep and oxen,

whatever passes along the paths of the seas.<br><br>

how majestic is your name in all the earth!<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 8 is a hymn of praise attributed to King David. It exalts the majesty and greatness of God's name while marveling at His creation and His care for humanity.</h4>
            The psalm begins and ends with a proclamation of the majesty of the Lord's name throughout the earth. David acknowledges the exalted position of God, whose glory surpasses the heavens themselves.<br><br>

            David marvels at God's use of the weak and vulnerable to demonstrate His strength. Even through the mouths of babies and infants, God establishes strength to silence His enemies and those who oppose Him.<br><br>
            
            When David contemplates the vastness of the heavens, with the moon and stars that God has set in place, he is struck by the insignificance of humanity in comparison. He wonders why God, who encompasses all of creation, would be mindful of human beings and care for them.<br><br>
            
            Despite this apparent insignificance, David recognizes that God has bestowed honor upon humanity. Though made a little lower than the heavenly beings, humans have been crowned with glory and honor by God. They have been given dominion over the works of God's hands, with all creatures subject to them.<br><br>
            
            David acknowledges the comprehensive dominion given to humanity. From sheep and oxen to the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, God has placed all things under human control.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes by reiterating the praise and exaltation of the Lord's name throughout the earth. David affirms the majesty of God and acknowledges His greatness and authority.<br><br></p>    
        <p><h4>Psalm 8 celebrates the magnificence of God's name, His creation, and His care for humanity. It acknowledges the contrast between the vastness of the universe and the seemingly insignificant nature of human beings. Nevertheless, it marvels at God's honor and dominion bestowed upon humanity, emphasizing the greatness of God's name and His position as Lord over all.</h4></p>
