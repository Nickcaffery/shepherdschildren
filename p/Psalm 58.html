        1. Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods?
        Do you judge the children of man uprightly?<br><br>
        2. No, in your hearts you devise wrongs;
        your hands deal out violence on earth.<br><br>
        
        3. The wicked are estranged from the womb;
        they go astray from birth, speaking lies.<br><br>
        4. They have venom like the venom of a serpent,
        like the deaf adder that stops its ear,<br><br>
        5. so that it does not hear the voice of charmers
        or of the cunning enchanter.<br><br>
        
        6. O God, break the teeth in their mouths;
        tear out the fangs of the young lions, O Lord!<br><br>
        7. Let them vanish like water that runs away;
        when he aims his arrows, let them be blunted.<br><br>
        8. Let them be like the snail that dissolves into slime,
        like the stillborn child who never sees the sun.<br><br>
        9. Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns,
        whether green or ablaze, may he sweep them away!<br><br>
        
        10. The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance;
        he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked.<br><br>
        11. Mankind will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous;
        surely there is a God who judges on earth."<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 58 is a prayer of David, expressing his plea for divine judgment upon the wicked. It portrays the wicked as those who devise evil, speak lies, and deal out violence on the earth. David appeals to God to intervene and bring justice.</h4>
            David begins by addressing the "gods" or judges, questioning if they truly decree what is right and judge with fairness. He asserts that these judges, in their hearts, devise wrongs and perpetrate violence.<br><br>

            David describes the wicked as being estranged from the womb, going astray from birth, and speaking lies. He compares their venom to that of a serpent and emphasizes their refusal to listen to any form of enchantment or charm.<br><br>
            
            In his plea for justice, David calls upon God to break the teeth in the mouths of the wicked and tear out the fangs of the young lions. He asks that they vanish like water that runs away and that their arrows be blunted. He further likens them to a snail dissolving into slime and a stillborn child who never sees the sun. David desires a swift and thorough removal of their influence.<br><br>
            
            David expresses the rejoicing of the righteous when they witness divine vengeance. He depicts them metaphorically bathing their feet in the blood of the wicked, symbolizing their satisfaction in the fulfillment of God's judgment. He concludes by proclaiming that mankind will recognize and acknowledge that there is a reward for the righteous and that there is a God who judges on the earth.<br><br></p>
