        <p><h4>Psalm 70 is a brief and urgent plea for God's swift deliverance and assistance. It expresses the psalmist's desire for the defeat and shame of their enemies, and it ends with a declaration of trust in God's help and deliverance.</h4>
            The psalm begins with an urgent cry for God to make haste and deliver the psalmist. The psalmist implores God to quickly come to their aid.<br><br>

            The psalmist asks that those who seek their life be put to shame and confusion. They desire that those who delight in their harm be turned back and brought to dishonor. The psalmist prays for their enemies to experience shame and humiliation, particularly those who mockingly say, "Aha, Aha!"<br><br>
            
            In contrast to the enemies, the psalmist calls upon those who seek God to rejoice and be glad in Him. They encourage those who love God's salvation to continually declare, "God is great!" This is a proclamation of praise and exaltation of God's greatness.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist acknowledges their own state of poverty and neediness. They implore God to hasten to them, recognizing Him as their help and deliverer. The psalmist appeals to God not to delay in providing assistance.<br><br></p>
