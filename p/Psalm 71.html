        1. In you, O Lord, do I take refuge;
        let me never be put to shame!<br><br>
        2. In your righteousness deliver me and rescue me;
        incline your ear to me, and save me!<br><br>
        3. Be to me a rock of refuge,
        to which I may continually come;
        you have given the command to save me,
        for you are my rock and my fortress.<br><br>
        
        4. Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked,
        from the grasp of the unjust and cruel man.<br><br>
        5. For you, O Lord, are my hope,
        my trust, O Lord, from my youth.<br><br>
        6. Upon you I have leaned from before my birth;
        you are he who took me from my mother's womb.
        My praise is continually of you.<br><br>
        
        7. I have been as a portent to many,
        but you are my strong refuge.<br><br>
        8. My mouth is filled with your praise,
        and with your glory all the day.<br><br>
        9. Do not cast me off in the time of old age;
        forsake me not when my strength is spent.<br><br>
        10. For my enemies speak concerning me;
        those who watch for my life consult together<br><br>
        11. and say, "God has forsaken him;
        pursue and seize him,
        for there is none to deliver him."<br><br>
        
        12. O God, be not far from me;
        O my God, make haste to help me!<br><br>
        13. May my accusers be put to shame and consumed;
        with scorn and disgrace may they be covered
        who seek my hurt.<br><br>
        14. But I will hope continually
        and will praise you yet more and more.<br><br>
        15. My mouth will tell of your righteous acts,
        of your deeds of salvation all the day,
        for their number is past my knowledge.<br><br>
        16. With the mighty deeds of the Lord God I will come;
        I will remind them of your righteousness, yours alone.<br><br>
        
        17. O God, from my youth you have taught me,
        and I still proclaim your wondrous deeds.<br><br>
        18. So even to old age and gray hairs,
        O God, do not forsake me,
        until I proclaim your might to another generation,
        your power to all those to come.<br><br>
        19. Your righteousness, O God,
        reaches the high heavens.
        You who have done great things,
        O God, who is like you?<br><br>
        20. You who have made me see many troubles and calamities
        will revive me again;
        from the depths of the earth
        you will bring me up again.<br><br>
        21. You will increase my greatness
        and comfort me again.<br><br>
        
        22. I will also praise you with the harp
        for your faithfulness, O my God;
        I will sing praises to you with the lyre,
        O Holy One of Israel.<br><br>
        23. My lips will shout for joy,
        when I sing praises to you;
        my soul also, which you have redeemed.<br><br>
        24. And my tongue will talk of your righteous help all the day long,
        for they have been put to shame and disappointed
        who sought to do me hurt.<br><br></p>
