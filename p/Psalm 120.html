        <p><h4>Psalm 120 is a psalm of lament and supplication. The psalmist expresses distress and seeks deliverance from those who speak lies and practice deceit. The psalmist longs for peace but finds themselves dwelling among people who hate peace and seek conflict.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by recounting their experience of distress and how they called upon the Lord, who answered them. They appeal to the Lord to deliver them from lying lips and deceitful tongues, highlighting the harm caused by false and deceptive speech.<br><br>

            The psalmist then directs a rhetorical question to the deceitful tongue, questioning what should be given to it and what further harm should befall it. They respond with imagery of a warrior's sharp arrows and glowing coals of the broom tree, depicting the consequences that await those who engage in deceitful speech.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist expresses a sense of lament and discomfort with their current situation. They mention Meshech and the tents of Kedar, which likely represent foreign and hostile lands. The psalmist feels like a sojourner or resident in these places, expressing their longing for a different dwelling.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist laments that they have dwelled among people who hate peace for far too long. Despite their desire for peace, the psalmist faces opposition and hostility from those around them. They affirm their commitment to peace, but when they speak, those around them respond with a disposition for war.<br><br></p>
