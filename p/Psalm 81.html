        1. Sing aloud to God our strength;
        shout for joy to the God of Jacob!<br><br>
        2. Raise a song; sound the tambourine,
        the sweet lyre with the harp.<br><br>
        3. Blow the trumpet at the new moon,
        at the full moon, on our feast day.<br><br>
        
        4. For it is a statute for Israel,
        a rule of the God of Jacob.<br><br>
        5. He made it a decree in Joseph
        when he went out over the land of Egypt.
        I hear a language I had not known:<br><br>
        6. "I relieved your shoulder of the burden;
        your hands were freed from the basket.<br><br>
        7. In distress you called, and I delivered you;
        I answered you in the secret place of thunder;
        I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah<br><br>
        
        8. Hear, O my people, while I admonish you!
        O Israel, if you would but listen to me!<br><br>
        9. There shall be no strange god among you;
        you shall not bow down to a foreign god.<br><br>
        10. I am the Lord your God,
        who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
        Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.<br><br>
        
        11. "But my people did not listen to my voice;
        Israel would not submit to me.<br><br>
        12. So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts,
        to follow their own counsels.<br><br>
        13. Oh, that my people would listen to me,
        that Israel would walk in my ways!<br><br>
        14. I would soon subdue their enemies
        and turn my hand against their foes.<br><br>
        15. Those who hate the Lord would cringe toward him,
        and their fate would last forever.<br><br>
        16. But he would feed you with the finest of the wheat,
        and with honey from the rock I would satisfy you."<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 81 is a song of praise and a call to obedience. The psalmist encourages the people of Israel to sing, shout for joy, and celebrate God as their strength and the God of Jacob. They exhort the people to raise a song, play instruments, and blow the trumpet during the new moon and feast days.</h4>
            The psalmist reminds the people that observing these celebrations and appointed times is a statute and rule established by God. They recall how God decreed this in Joseph when He led them out of Egypt. The psalmist recounts how God relieved the people's burdens and delivered them in times of distress. God answered them in the secret place of thunder and tested them at the waters of Meribah.<br><br>

            The psalm takes a turn as God speaks, admonishing the people to listen and heed His words. God declares that there should be no other gods among them, and they should not worship foreign gods. He identifies Himself as the Lord, their God, who brought them out of Egypt. God invites the people to open their mouths wide, assuring them that He will fill them.<br><br>
            
            However, the psalmist laments that the people did not listen to God's voice and refused to submit to Him. As a result, God gave them over to their stubborn hearts and allowed them to follow their own counsel. The psalmist expresses a longing for the people to listen and walk in God's ways. They acknowledge that if the people were obedient, God would subdue their enemies and turn His hand against their foes. Those who hate the Lord would cringe before Him, and their fate would last forever. On the other hand, God would abundantly provide for His people, feeding them with the finest wheat and satisfying them with honey from the rock.<br><br></p>    
        <p><h4>Psalm 81 serves as a reminder to the people of Israel to praise God and obey His commands. It recounts God's deliverance and faithfulness to them and calls them to listen and follow His ways. The psalmist expresses the longing for the people to be obedient so that they may experience God's victory over their enemies and enjoy His abundant provision.</h4></p>
