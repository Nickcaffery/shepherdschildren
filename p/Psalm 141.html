        1. O Lord, I call upon you; hasten to me!
        Give ear to my voice when I call to you!<br><br>
        2. Let my prayer be counted as incense before you,
        and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice!<br><br>
        
        3. Set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth;
        keep watch over the door of my lips!<br><br>
        4. Do not let my heart incline to any evil,
        to busy myself with wicked deeds
        in company with men who work iniquity,
        and let me not eat of their delicacies!<br><br>
        
        5. Let a righteous man strike me—it is a kindness;
        let him rebuke me—it is oil for my head;
        let my head not refuse it.
        Yet my prayer is continually against their evil deeds.<br><br>
        6. When their judges are thrown over the cliff,
        then they shall hear my words, for they are pleasant.<br><br>
        7. As when one plows and breaks up the earth,
        so shall our bones be scattered at the mouth of Sheol.<br><br>
        
        8. But my eyes are toward you, O God, my Lord;
        in you I seek refuge; leave me not defenseless!<br><br>
        9. Keep me from the trap that they have laid for me
        and from the snares of evildoers!<br><br>
        10. Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
        while I pass by safely.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 141 is a prayer of the psalmist, seeking the Lord's attention and protection against evil and wickedness. The psalmist calls upon the Lord to listen to their voice and to consider their prayer as an offering of incense and the lifting up of hands as an evening sacrifice.</h4>
            The psalmist asks the Lord to set a guard over their mouth and to watch over the door of their lips, indicating a desire for control over their speech. They pray for their heart not to be inclined towards evil or to engage in wicked deeds in the company of those who practice iniquity. The psalmist expresses a desire to abstain from partaking in the indulgences of the wicked.<br><br>

            The psalmist welcomes the rebuke and correction of a righteous person, considering it as a kindness and oil for their head. They do not want to refuse such correction but continually pray against the evil deeds of those around them.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist envisions a judgment upon the wicked, where their judges are thrown over a cliff, and their ears are opened to hear the psalmist's words. The psalmist uses imagery of plowing and breaking up the earth to describe the scattering of bones at the mouth of Sheol, depicting the consequences of the wicked's actions.<br><br>
            
            Despite the presence of evil and wickedness, the psalmist's eyes remain fixed on God. They seek refuge in Him, asking not to be left defenseless. The psalmist implores the Lord to keep them from the traps and snares set by evildoers. They express their trust that while the wicked may fall into their own nets, they will pass by safely.<br><br></p>
