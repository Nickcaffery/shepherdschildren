        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 76 is a song that exalts God's power and majesty, particularly in His victory over enemies. It acknowledges His presence in Judah and Zion, praises His greatness, and emphasizes His ability to bring down the proud and establish judgment.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by proclaiming that God is known in Judah, and His name is esteemed in Israel. They mention God's abode in Salem (likely referring to Jerusalem) and His dwelling place in Zion. They acknowledge that in Zion, God broke the weapons of war, including flashing arrows, shields, and swords. The psalmist calls for a moment of reflection with the word "Selah" to emphasize the significance of these actions.<br><br>

            The psalmist extols the glorious and majestic nature of God, comparing Him to mountains filled with prey. They describe how the stouthearted, the mighty warriors, were stripped of their spoils and rendered powerless. These warriors sank into sleep and were unable to use their hands. The psalmist attributes this to God's rebuke, highlighting His authority and power over both rider and horse.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist declares that God is to be feared, emphasizing the awe-inspiring nature of His power. They question who can stand before God once His anger is aroused. They describe how God's judgment is proclaimed from the heavens, causing the earth to fear and become still. They recognize that God arose to establish judgment and save the humble of the earth. The word "Selah" is repeated, indicating a moment for reflection.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist acknowledges that even the wrath of man ultimately praises God. They express that the remnants of wrath are like a belt that God wears. They exhort the people to make vows to the Lord their God and to fulfill them. They encourage everyone around God to bring gifts, recognizing His awe-inspiring nature. They emphasize that God has the authority to cut off the spirit of princes and is to be feared by the kings of the earth.<br><br></p>
