        1. Give ear to my words, O Lord;
        consider my groaning.<br><br>
        2. Give attention to the sound of my cry,
        my King and my God,
        for to you do I pray.<br><br>
        3. O Lord, in the morning you hear my voice;
        in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for you and watch.<br><br>
        
        4. For you are not a God who delights in wickedness;
        evil may not dwell with you.<br><br>
        5. The boastful shall not stand before your eyes;
        you hate all evildoers.<br><br>
        6. You destroy those who speak lies;
        the Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.<br><br>
        
        7. But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love,
        will enter your house.
        I will bow down toward your holy temple
        in the fear of you.<br><br>
        8. Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness
        because of my enemies;
        make your way straight before me.<br><br>
        
        9. For there is no truth in their mouth;
        their inmost self is destruction;
        their throat is an open grave;
        they flatter with their tongue.<br><br>
        10. Make them bear their guilt, O God;
        let them fall by their own counsels;
        because of the abundance of their transgressions cast them out,
        for they have rebelled against you.<br><br>
        
        11. But let all who take refuge in you rejoice;
        let them ever sing for joy,
        and spread your protection over them,
        that those who love your name may exult in you.<br><br>
        12. For you bless the righteous, O Lord;
        you cover him with favor as with a shield.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 5 is a prayer attributed to King David, expressing his plea for God's guidance, deliverance, and protection. It portrays David's trust in God's righteousness and his desire for justice against evildoers.</h4>
            The psalm begins with a plea for God to listen and consider the distress and cries of the psalmist. David addresses God as his King and God, acknowledging His authority and his own submission. He expresses his devotion and commitment to prayer, highlighting his practice of seeking God in the morning.<br><br>

            David acknowledges that God does not delight in wickedness and that evil cannot dwell with Him. He emphasizes God's righteous nature and His hatred for evildoers and those who deceive with lies. David recognizes God's power to destroy and His abhorrence of bloodthirstiness and deceit.<br><br>
            
            In contrast to the wicked, David expresses his trust in God's steadfast love. He desires to enter God's presence, bowing in reverence and fear. He calls on God to lead him in righteousness and make His way straight before him, particularly in the face of enemies.<br><br>
            
            David continues to describe the wicked, emphasizing their deceitful nature and destructive intentions.
