      1. Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness!
You have given me relief when I was in distress.
Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!<br><br>

2. O men, how long shall my honor be turned into shame?
How long will you love vain words and seek after lies? Selah<br><br>

the Lord hears when I call to him.<br><br>

4. Be angry, and do not sin;
ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. Selah<br><br>
5. Offer right sacrifices,
and put your trust in the Lord.<br><br>

6. There are many who say, "Who will show us some good?
Lift up the light of your face upon us, O Lord!"<br><br>
7. You have put more joy in my heart
than they have when their grain and wine abound.<br><br>

8. In peace I will both lie down and sleep;
for you alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 4 is attributed to King David and serves as a prayer for deliverance, seeking God's intervention in a time of distress. It expresses David's trust in God's righteousness and his reliance on Him for protection and peace.</h4>
            In the opening verses, David calls upon God to answer his prayers and extend His grace. He acknowledges God's past faithfulness in providing relief during times of distress. David implores God to listen to his prayer.<br><br>

            David then addresses his opponents, questioning their actions and motives. He asks how long they will turn his honor into shame and embrace falsehoods. He reminds them that the Lord has set apart the godly for Himself and assures them that God hears his calls for help.<br><br>
            
            Verse 4 contains the word "Selah," indicating a musical pause for reflection. David advises his adversaries to be angry but warns them not to sin. He encourages self-reflection and silence, urging them to offer right sacrifices and place their trust in the Lord.<br><br>
            
            In verse 6, David highlights the common desire for good and invokes the Lord to shine His favor upon them. He acknowledges that God has filled his heart with more joy than the abundance of grain and wine brings to others.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a declaration of peace and trust. David expresses his confidence that he can lie down and sleep in peace because the Lord alone makes him dwell in safety. It conveys David's assurance in God's protective care and his ability to find rest and security in Him.<br><br></p>
