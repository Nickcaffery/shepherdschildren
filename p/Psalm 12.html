        1. Save, O Lord, for the godly one is gone;

        with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.<br><br>
        
        3. May the Lord cut off all flattering lips,

        6. The words of the Lord are pure words,

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 12 is a psalm of lament and trust in God's faithfulness in the midst of a corrupt and deceitful world. It addresses the prevalence of lies, flattery, and oppression, calling upon the Lord for deliverance and affirming His promise to protect the righteous.</h4>
            The psalm begins with a cry for salvation, as the godly and faithful people seem to have disappeared or diminished among the children of humanity. The psalmist laments the abundance of lies and deceitful speech, with people speaking with flattering lips and double hearts.<br><br>

            The psalmist petitions the Lord to cut off those who use flattering lips and make great boasts. They challenge the arrogance of those who believe their speech alone will lead them to prevail, asserting their independence from any higher authority.<br><br>
            
            In verses 5 and 6, the psalm shifts to the response of the Lord. The Lord declares that He will arise and take action on behalf of the poor and the needy who are plundered and groaning. The psalmist expresses confidence in God's promise to place the oppressed in the safety they long for.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist then affirms the purity and reliability of the words of the Lord. The words of God are likened to silver refined in a furnace, purified seven times. They are seen as trustworthy and true.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist expresses trust in God's protection, acknowledging that the Lord will keep the words of promise and guard His people from the present generation and its wickedness.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes by noting the pervasive presence of the wicked, as vileness and corruption seem to be exalted among humanity. This underscores the need for God's intervention and deliverance.<br><br></p>
