        1. Contend, O Lord, with those who contend with me;
        fight against those who fight against me!<br><br>
        2. Take hold of shield and buckler
        and rise for my help!<br><br>
        3. Draw the spear and javelin
        against my pursuers!
        Say to my soul,
        "I am your salvation!"<br><br>
        
        4. Let them be put to shame and dishonor
        who seek after my life!
        Let them be turned back and disappointed
        who devise evil against me!<br><br>
        5. Let them be like chaff before the wind,
        with the angel of the Lord driving them away!<br><br>
        6. Let their way be dark and slippery,
        with the angel of the Lord pursuing them!<br><br>
        
        7. For without cause they hid their net for me;
        without cause they dug a pit for my life.<br><br>
        8. Let destruction come upon him when he does not know it!
        And let the net that he hid ensnare him;
        let him fall into it—to his destruction!<br><br>
        
        9. Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord,
        exulting in his salvation.<br><br>
        10. All my bones shall say,
        "O Lord, who is like you,
        delivering the poor
        from him who is too strong for him,
        the poor and needy from him who robs him?"<br><br>
        
        11. Malicious witnesses rise up;
        they ask me of things that I do not know.<br><br>
        12. They repay me evil for good;
        my soul is bereft.<br><br>
        13. But I, when they were sick—
        I wore sackcloth;
        I afflicted myself with fasting;
        I prayed with head bowed on my chest.<br><br>
        14. I went about as though I grieved for my friend or my brother;
        as one who laments his mother,
        I bowed down in mourning.<br><br>
        
        15. But at my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered;
        they gathered together against me;
        wretches whom I did not know
        tore at me without ceasing;<br><br>
        16. like profane mockers at a feast,
        they gnash at me with their teeth.<br><br>
        
        17. How long, O Lord, will you look on?
        Rescue me from their destruction,
        my precious life from the lions!<br><br>
        18. I will thank you in the great congregation;
        in the mighty throng I will praise you.<br><br>
        
        19. Let not those rejoice over me
        who are wrongfully my foes,
        and let not those wink the eye
        who hate me without cause.<br><br>
        20. For they do not speak peace,
        but against those who are quiet in the land
        they devise words of deceit.<br><br>
        21. They open wide their mouths against me;
        they say, "Aha, Aha!
        Our eyes have seen it!"<br><br>
        
        22. You have seen, O Lord; be not silent!
        O Lord, be not far from me!<br><br>
        23. Awake and rouse yourself for my vindication,
        for my cause, my God and my Lord!<br><br>
        24. Vindicate me, O Lord, my God,
        according to your righteousness,
        and let them not rejoice over me!<br><br>
        
        25. Let them not say in their hearts,
        "Aha, our heart's desire!"
        Let them not say, "We have swallowed him up."<br><br>
        
        26. Let them be put to shame and disappointed altogether
        who rejoice at my calamity!
        Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor
        who magnify themselves against me!<br><br>
        
        27. Let those who delight in my righteousness
        shout for joy and be glad
        and say evermore,
        "Great is the Lord,
        who delights in the welfare of his servant!"<br><br>
        28. Then my tongue shall tell of your righteousness
        and of your praise all the day long.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 35 is a plea for God's intervention and justice against the psalmist's enemies. The psalmist calls upon the Lord to contend with those who contend with them and to fight against those who fight against them. They implore God to rise up and provide help, wielding weapons of defense and declaring Himself as their salvation.</h4>
            The psalmist asks that those who seek after their life be put to shame, turned back, and disappointed. They desire that their enemies be driven away like chaff before the wind, pursued and engulfed in darkness. The psalmist prays for the destruction of those who have set traps and dug pits for their life, asking that the net they hid ensnares them instead.<br><br>

            The psalmist declares that their soul will rejoice in the Lord and exult in His salvation. They praise God for delivering the poor and the needy from those who are stronger and seek to rob them. The psalmist laments the malicious witnesses who rise up against them, repaying evil for their good deeds. They recount their acts of self-affliction and mourning on behalf of their enemies, expressing the unjust treatment they have received.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist pleads for God's rescue from their enemies' destruction and the preservation of their precious life. They vow to thank and praise the Lord in the great congregation and mighty throng. They request that their wrongfully accused foes not rejoice over them and that those who hate them without cause not mock or deceive them.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist appeals to God, asking Him not to remain silent or far away but to awaken and rise up for their vindication. They call upon God to judge them according to His righteousness and prevent their enemies from rejoicing over their downfall.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist prays against those who delight in their calamity, asking for their shame and disappointment. They desire that those who take pleasure in their righteousness shout for joy and proclaim the greatness of the Lord, who delights in the welfare of His servant. The psalmist declares their commitment to telling of God's righteousness and praising Him throughout the day.<br><br></p>
