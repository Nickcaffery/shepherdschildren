        1. Give the king your justice, O God,
        and your righteousness to the royal son!<br><br>
        2. May he judge your people with righteousness,
        and your poor with justice!<br><br>
        3. Let the mountains bear prosperity for the people,
        and the hills, in righteousness!<br><br>
        4. May he defend the cause of the poor of the people,
        give deliverance to the children of the needy,
        and crush the oppressor!<br><br>
        
        5. May they fear you while the sun endures,
        and as long as the moon, throughout all generations!<br><br>
        6. May he be like rain that falls on the mown grass,
        like showers that water the earth!<br><br>
        7. In his days may the righteous flourish,
        and peace abound, till the moon be no more!<br><br>
        
        8. May he have dominion from sea to sea,
        and from the River to the ends of the earth!<br><br>
        9. May desert tribes bow down before him,
        and his enemies lick the dust!<br><br>
        10. May the kings of Tarshish and of the coastlands
        render him tribute;
        may the kings of Sheba and Seba
        bring gifts!<br><br>
        11. May all kings fall down before him,
        all nations serve him!<br><br>
        
        12. For he delivers the needy when he calls,
        the poor and him who has no helper.<br><br>
        13. He has pity on the weak and the needy,
        and saves the lives of the needy.<br><br>
        14. From oppression and violence he redeems their life,
        and precious is their blood in his sight.<br><br>
        
        15. Long may he live;
        may gold of Sheba be given to him!
        May prayer be made for him continually,
        and blessings invoked for him all the day!<br><br>
        16. May there be abundance of grain in the land;
        on the tops of the mountains may it wave;
        may its fruit be like Lebanon;
        and may people blossom in the cities
        like the grass of the field!<br><br>
        17. May his name endure forever,
        his fame continue as long as the sun!
        May people be blessed in him,
        all nations call him blessed!<br><br>
        
        18. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
        who alone does wondrous things.<br><br>
        19. Blessed be his glorious name forever;
        may the whole earth be filled with his glory!
        Amen and Amen!<br><br>
