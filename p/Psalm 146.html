in a son of man, in whom there is no salvation.<br><br>

on that very day his plans perish.<br><br>

whose hope is in the Lord his God,<br><br>
6. who made heaven and earth,
the sea, and all that is in them,
who keeps faith forever;<br><br>
7. who executes justice for the oppressed,
who gives food to the hungry.

The Lord sets the prisoners free;<br><br>
8. the Lord opens the eyes of the blind.
The Lord lifts up those who are bowed down;
the Lord loves the righteous.<br><br>
9. The Lord watches over the sojourners;
he upholds the widow and the fatherless,
but the way of the wicked he brings to ruin.<br><br>

10. The Lord will reign forever,
your God, O Zion, to all generations.
Praise the Lord!<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 146 is a psalm of praise, exalting the Lord and encouraging trust in Him rather than in earthly powers. The psalmist begins by urging their soul to praise the Lord, vowing to praise Him as long as they live and sing praises to God throughout their existence.</h4>
