        1. Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised
        in the city of our God!
        His holy mountain,<br><br> 2. beautiful in elevation,
        is the joy of all the earth,
        Mount Zion, in the far north,
        the city of the great King.<br><br>
        3. Within her citadels God
        has made himself known as a fortress.<br><br>
        
        4. For behold, the kings assembled;
        they came on together.<br><br>
        5. As soon as they saw it, they were astounded;
        they were in panic; they took to flight.<br><br>
        6. Trembling took hold of them there,
        anguish as of a woman in labor.<br><br>
        7. By the east wind you shattered
        the ships of Tarshish.<br><br>
        8. As we have heard, so have we seen
        in the city of the Lord of hosts,
        in the city of our God,
        which God will establish forever. Selah<br><br>
        
        9. We have thought on your steadfast love, O God,
        in the midst of your temple.<br><br>
        10. As your name, O God,
        so your praise reaches to the ends of the earth.
        Your right hand is filled with righteousness.<br><br>
        11. Let Mount Zion be glad!
        Let the daughters of Judah rejoice
        because of your judgments!<br><br>
        
        12. Walk about Zion, go around her,
        number her towers,<br><br>
        13. consider well her ramparts,
        go through her citadels,
        that you may tell the next generation<br><br>
        14. that this is God,
        our God forever and ever.
        He will guide us forever.<br><br></p>
