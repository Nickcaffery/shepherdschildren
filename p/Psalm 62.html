        1. For God alone my soul waits in silence;
        from him comes my salvation.<br><br>
        2. He alone is my rock and my salvation,
        my fortress; I shall not be greatly shaken.<br><br>
        
        3. How long will all of you attack a man
        to batter him,
        like a leaning wall, a tottering fence?<br><br>
        4. They only plan to thrust him down from his high position.
        They take pleasure in falsehood.
        They bless with their mouths,
        but inwardly they curse. Selah<br><br>
        
        5. For God alone, O my soul, wait in silence,
        for my hope is from him.<br><br>
        6. He only is my rock and my salvation,
        my fortress; I shall not be shaken.<br><br>
        7. On God rests my salvation and my glory;
        my mighty rock, my refuge is God.<br><br>
        
        8. Trust in him at all times, O people;
        pour out your heart before him;
        God is a refuge for us. Selah<br><br>
        
        9. Those of low estate are but a breath;
        those of high estate are a delusion;
        in the balances they go up;
        they are together lighter than a breath.<br><br>
        10. Put no trust in extortion;
        set no vain hopes on robbery;
        if riches increase, set not your heart on them.<br><br>
        
        11. Once God has spoken;
        twice have I heard this:
        that power belongs to God,<br><br>
        12. and that to you, O Lord, belongs steadfast love.
        For you will render to a man
        according to his work.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 62, attributed to David, expresses trust and confidence in God as the sole source of salvation and refuge. It contrasts the fleeting nature of human power and deceit with the steadfastness and faithfulness of God.</h4>
            David begins by declaring his complete dependence on God. He waits in silence for God, knowing that salvation comes from Him alone. God is described as his rock, salvation, and fortress, assuring David that he will not be greatly shaken or overwhelmed.<br><br>

            David addresses those who attack him and seek to bring him down. He acknowledges their deceptive intentions and false blessings, which are accompanied by inward curses. He recognizes their attempts to undermine his position and cause harm.<br><br>
            
            David reaffirms his trust in God, urging his soul to wait in silence and place hope in Him alone. He emphasizes once again that God is his rock, salvation, and fortress, ensuring that he will not be shaken. David acknowledges that his salvation and glory rest solely on God, who is his mighty rock and refuge.<br><br>
            
            David encourages the people to trust in God at all times, pouring out their hearts before Him. He reassures them that God is their refuge. The psalmist interjects with "Selah," which signifies a pause or reflection.<br><br>
            
            David reflects on the fleeting nature of human existence and the unreliability of worldly power. He highlights that those of low and high estate are ultimately insignificant when weighed against God. He warns against putting trust in extortion or setting vain hopes on robbery. David cautions against placing one's heart on increasing riches.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with David affirming God's authority and steadfast love. He declares that power belongs to God and that God renders to each person according to their work.<br><br></p>
