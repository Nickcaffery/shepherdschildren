        1. Praise the Lord!
        Praise the name of the Lord,
        give praise, O servants of the Lord,<br><br>
        2. who stand in the house of the Lord,
        in the courts of the house of our God!<br><br>
        3. Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good;
        sing to his name, for it is pleasant!<br><br>
        4. For the Lord has chosen Jacob for himself,
        Israel as his own possession.<br><br>
        
        5. For I know that the Lord is great,
        and that our Lord is above all gods.<br><br>
        6. Whatever the Lord pleases, he does,
        in heaven and on earth,
        in the seas and all deeps.<br><br>
        7. He it is who makes the clouds rise at the end of the earth,
        who makes lightnings for the rain
        and brings forth the wind from his storehouses.<br><br>
        
        8. He it was who struck down the firstborn of Egypt,
        both of man and of beast;<br><br>
        9. who in your midst, O Egypt,
        sent signs and wonders
        against Pharaoh and all his servants;<br><br>
        10. who struck down many nations
        and killed mighty kings,<br><br>
        11. Sihon, king of the Amorites,
        and Og, king of Bashan,
        and all the kingdoms of Canaan,<br><br>
        12. and gave their land as a heritage,
        a heritage to his people Israel.<br><br>
        
        13. Your name, O Lord, endures forever,
        your renown, O Lord, throughout all ages.<br><br>
        14. For the Lord will vindicate his people
        and have compassion on his servants.<br><br>
        
        15. The idols of the nations are silver and gold,
        the work of human hands.<br><br>
        16. They have mouths, but do not speak;
        they have eyes, but do not see;<br><br>
        17. they have ears, but do not hear,
        nor is there any breath in their mouths.<br><br>
        18. Those who make them become like them,
        so do all who trust in them!<br><br>
        
        19. O house of Israel, bless the Lord!
        O house of Aaron, bless the Lord!<br><br>
        20. O house of Levi, bless the Lord!
        You who fear the Lord, bless the Lord!<br><br>
        21. Blessed be the Lord from Zion,
        he who dwells in Jerusalem!
        Praise the Lord!<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 135 is a psalm of praise that exalts the Lord as the true God and extols His power, sovereignty, and faithfulness. It calls upon the servants of the Lord to offer praise and bless His name, declaring His goodness and mighty deeds.</h4>
            The psalm begins with a call to praise the Lord and His name, directed towards the servants of the Lord who serve in His house and courts. It invites them to acknowledge and extol the Lord's greatness, goodness, and pleasantness.<br><br>

            The psalmist affirms that the Lord has chosen Jacob (referring to Israel) as His own possession. It highlights the special relationship and covenant between God and His people, emphasizing His love and commitment to them.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist declares the Lord's greatness and supremacy over all gods. They acknowledge that the Lord has control over all creation, including heaven, earth, seas, and deeps. The psalmist highlights the Lord's power to control natural phenomena such as clouds, rain, and wind, recognizing His authority over the forces of nature.<br><br>
            
            The psalm recounts the Lord's mighty acts throughout history, such as the plagues in Egypt and the conquest of various nations and kings. It emphasizes the Lord's intervention on behalf of His people, demonstrating His faithfulness and deliverance.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist contrasts the idols of the nations, which are lifeless and powerless, with the living God. They point out the futility of worshipping and trusting in man-made idols that cannot speak, see, hear, or breathe. The psalmist warns that those who make and trust in idols become like themâ€”lifeless and powerless.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a call for the house of Israel, the house of Aaron (referring to the priests), the house of Levi (the priestly tribe), and all who fear the Lord to bless Him. It affirms the Lord's eternal name and renown, expressing confidence in His vindication of His people and His compassion towards His servants. The psalmist blesses the Lord from Zion, where He dwells in Jerusalem, and concludes with a final exclamation of praise.<br><br></p>
