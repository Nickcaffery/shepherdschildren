        1 My God, whom I praise, do not remain silent,<br><br>
2 for people who are wicked and deceitful have opened their mouths against me; they have spoken against me with lying tongues.<br><br>
3 With words of hatred they surround me; they attack me without cause.<br><br>
4 In return for my friendship they accuse me, but I am a man of prayer.<br><br>
5 They repay me evil for good, and hatred for my friendship.<br><br>
6 Appoint someone evil to oppose my enemy; let an accuser stand at his right hand.<br><br>
        7 When he is tried, let him come forth guilty;
        let his prayer be counted as sin!<br><br>
        8 May his days be few;
        may another take his office!<br><br>
        9 May his children be fatherless
        and his wife a widow!<br><br>
        10 May his children wander about and beg,
        seeking food far from the ruins they inhabit!<br><br>
        11 May the creditor seize all that he has;
        may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil!<br><br>
        12 Let there be none to extend kindness to him,
        nor any to pity his fatherless children!<br><br>
        13 May his posterity be cut off;
        may his name be blotted out in the second generation!<br><br>
        
        14 May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord,
        and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out!<br><br>
        15 Let them be before the Lord continually,
        that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth!<br><br>
        16 For he did not remember to show kindness,
        but pursued the poor and needy
        and the brokenhearted, to put them to death.<br><br>
        17 He loved to curse; let curses come upon him!
        He did not delight in blessing; may it be far from him!<br><br>
        18 He clothed himself with cursing as his coat;
        may it soak into his body like water,
        like oil into his bones!<br><br>
        19 May it be like a garment that he wraps around him,
        like a belt that he puts on every day!<br><br>
        20 May this be the reward of my accusers from the Lord,
        of those who speak evil against my life!<br><br>
        
        21 But you, O God my Lord,
        deal on my behalf for your name's sake;
        because your steadfast love is good, deliver me!<br><br>
        22 For I am poor and needy,
        and my heart is stricken within me.<br><br>
        23 I am gone like a shadow at evening;
        I am shaken off like a locust.<br><br>
        24 My knees are weak through fasting;
        my body has become gaunt, with no fat.<br><br>
        25 I am an object of scorn to my accusers;
        when they see me, they wag their heads.<br><br>
        
        26 Help me, O Lord my God!
        Save me according to your steadfast love!<br><br>
        27 Let them know that this is your hand;
        you, O Lord, have done it!<br><br>
        28 Let them curse, but you will bless!
        They arise and are put to shame, but your servant will be glad!<br><br>
        29 May my accusers be clothed with dishonor;
        may they be wrapped in their own shame as in a cloak!<br><br>
        
        30 With my mouth I will give great thanks to the Lord;
        I will praise him in the midst of the throng.<br><br>
        31 For he stands at the right hand of the needy one,
        to save him from those who condemn his soul to death.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 109 is a psalm of lament and imprecation. The psalmist, facing unjust accusations and hatred from their enemies, cries out to God for deliverance and justice. They express their distress and call upon God to intervene on their behalf.</h4>
            The psalmist describes how their enemies speak deceitfully and attack them with words of hate without cause. In return for the psalmist's love, they are accused and rewarded with evil and hatred. The psalmist prays for God's judgment upon their enemies, asking for their wickedness to be exposed and for them to face consequences.<br><br>

            The psalmist invokes curses upon their enemy, asking for a wicked man to be appointed against them, for guilt to be found in their trials, and for their prayers to be counted as sin. They desire for their enemy's days to be cut short, for their children to suffer, and for their name and posterity to be blotted out.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist recalls the iniquities of their enemy's fathers and calls for their sins to be remembered before the Lord. They describe the enemy's lack of kindness, pursuit of the poor and needy, and delight in cursing rather than blessing. The psalmist wishes curses to come upon their enemy, comparing them to a garment soaked with cursing.<br><br>
            
            Amidst their plea for justice, the psalmist turns to God and appeals for His intervention. They acknowledge their own poor and needy state, their stricken heart, and the scorn they face from their accusers. They implore God to deliver them and demonstrate His steadfast love.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist affirms their trust in God and calls for Him to be glorified through His deliverance. They express their confidence that God will bless them while their accusers will be clothed with dishonor and shame.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a declaration of thanksgiving and praise to the Lord. The psalmist pledges to give thanks and praise God in the midst of the people, recognizing His role as the defender of the needy and the one who saves from condemnation.<br><br></p>
