        1. O God, the nations have come into your inheritance;
        they have defiled your holy temple;
        they have laid Jerusalem in ruins.<br><br>
        2. They have given the bodies of your servants
        to the birds of the heavens for food,
        the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the earth.<br><br>
        3. They have poured out their blood like water
        all around Jerusalem,
        and there was no one to bury them.<br><br>
        4. We have become a taunt to our neighbors,
        mocked and derided by those around us.<br><br>
        
        5. How long, O Lord? Will you be angry forever?
        Will your jealousy burn like fire?<br><br>
        6. Pour out your anger on the nations
        that do not know you,
        and on the kingdoms
        that do not call upon your name!<br><br>
        7. For they have devoured Jacob
        and laid waste his habitation.<br><br>
        
        8. Do not remember against us our former iniquities;
        let your compassion come speedily to meet us,
        for we are brought very low.<br><br>
        9. Help us, O God of our salvation,
        for the glory of your name;
        deliver us, and atone for our sins,
        for your name's sake!<br><br>
        
        10. Why should the nations say,
        "Where is their God?"
        Let the avenging of the outpoured blood of your servants
        be known among the nations before our eyes!<br><br>
        
        11. Let the groans of the prisoners come before you;
        according to your great power, preserve those doomed to die!<br><br>
        12. Return sevenfold into the lap of our neighbors
        the taunts with which they have taunted you, O Lord!<br><br>
        13. But we your people, the sheep of your pasture,
        will give thanks to you forever;
        from generation to generation we will recount your praise.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 79 is a communal lament expressing deep distress over the destruction of Jerusalem and the desecration of God's holy temple. The psalmist cries out to God for help and pleads for His compassion and deliverance. They call for God's justice against the nations that have brought devastation and seek preservation for the people of Israel.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by describing how the nations have invaded God's inheritance, defiled the temple, and laid Jerusalem in ruins. They recount the horrifying treatment of the bodies of God's servants, left as food for birds and beasts. The blood of the people has been poured out all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to give them a proper burial. The psalmist laments how Israel has become a taunt and a mockery to their neighbors.<br><br>

            The psalmist questions the duration of God's anger and His burning jealousy. They implore God to pour out His anger on the nations that do not know Him and do not call upon His name. They acknowledge that these nations have devoured Jacob and laid waste to their homes.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist asks God not to remember their past iniquities but to show them compassion and deliverance. They appeal to the God of their salvation for help, asking Him to atone for their sins for the sake of His name and glory.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist raises the concern of the nations questioning the existence of Israel's God. They desire that the avenging of the spilled blood of God's servants be known among the nations, displaying God's justice and power.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist pleads for the groans of the prisoners to come before God, asking for preservation according to His great power. They ask God to return sevenfold the taunts that have been directed toward Him.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a declaration of the people's commitment to give thanks to God forever. They affirm that they are the sheep of His pasture and will recount His praise from generation to generation.<br><br></p>
