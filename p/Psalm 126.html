        1. When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion,
        we were like those who dream.<br><br>
        2. Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
        and our tongue with shouts of joy;
        then they said among the nations,
        "The Lord has done great things for them."<br><br>
        3. The Lord has done great things for us;

        shall reap with shouts of joy!<br><br>
        6. He who goes out weeping,
        bearing the seed for sowing,
        shall come home with shouts of joy,
        bringing his sheaves with him.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 126 is a psalm of joy and thanksgiving, celebrating the restoration of the fortunes of Zion. The psalmist vividly expresses the overwhelming joy and astonishment they felt when the Lord brought about their restoration.</h4>
            The psalmist describes the restoration as a dream come true. Their mouths were filled with laughter and shouts of joy as they marveled at the great things the Lord had done for them. The news of their restoration spread among the nations, and it was acknowledged that the Lord had done remarkable things for His people.<br><br>

            The psalmist declares that the Lord has indeed done great things for them, and they are filled with gladness and gratitude. The psalmist acknowledges God's hand in their restoration and gives thanks for His faithfulness and intervention.<br><br>
            
            In the latter part of the psalm, the psalmist prays for the continued restoration of their fortunes. They use the analogy of streams in the Negeb, a desert region, to symbolize the revival and abundance they long for. The psalmist expresses the belief that those who sow in tears, experiencing hardship and difficulty, will eventually reap with shouts of joy. They describe the journey of one who goes out weeping, carrying the seed for sowing, but returns home with shouts of joy, bringing the harvested sheaves.<br><br></p>
