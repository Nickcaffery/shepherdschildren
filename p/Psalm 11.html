        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 11 is a psalm of trust in God's righteousness and justice, attributed to King David. It addresses the challenges and doubts faced by the righteous in the face of wickedness and the assurance of God's presence and judgment.</h4>
            The psalm begins with a declaration of taking refuge in the Lord. The psalmist questions those who urge him to flee like a bird to the mountains, suggesting that he should seek safety elsewhere. Instead, the psalmist affirms his trust in God as his refuge.<br><br>

            The psalmist describes the wicked who are ready to attack and harm the righteous. The imagery of bending bows and fitting arrows to the string portrays their readiness for violence.<br><br>
            
            In verse 3, the psalmist presents a rhetorical question: "If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?" This conveys a sense of hopelessness or doubt regarding the state of the world and the ability of the righteous to stand against the wicked.<br><br>
            
            However, the psalmist quickly reminds himself and others of the sovereignty and righteousness of the Lord. God is depicted as being in His holy temple and seated on His heavenly throne. His watchful eyes see and test the children of humanity.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist emphasizes that the Lord tests the righteous, examining their hearts and actions, while expressing God's hatred toward the wicked and those who love violence. The psalmist calls upon God to rain coals, fire, sulfur, and a scorching wind upon the wicked as their just retribution.<br><br>
            
            Verse 7 affirms the righteousness of the Lord. He loves righteous deeds, and the upright will have the privilege of beholding His face. This serves as a reminder of the ultimate reward and communion with God that awaits those who remain faithful and upright.<br><br></p>
