        1. Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven,
        whose sin is covered.<br><br>
        2. Blessed is the man against whom the Lord counts no iniquity,
        and in whose spirit there is no deceit.<br><br>
        
        3. For when I kept silent, my bones wasted away
        through my groaning all day long.<br><br>
        4. For day and night your hand was heavy upon me;
        my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer. Selah<br><br>
        
        5. I acknowledged my sin to you,
        and I did not cover my iniquity;
        I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,"
        and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah<br><br>
        
        6. Therefore let everyone who is godly
        offer prayer to you at a time when you may be found;
        surely in the rush of great waters,
        they shall not reach him.<br><br>
        7. You are a hiding place for me;
        you preserve me from trouble;
        you surround me with shouts of deliverance. Selah<br><br>
        
        8. I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go;
        I will counsel you with my eye upon you.<br><br>
        9. Be not like a horse or a mule, without understanding,
        which must be curbed with bit and bridle,
        or it will not stay near you.<br><br>
        
        10. Many are the sorrows of the wicked,
        but steadfast love surrounds the one who trusts in the Lord.<br><br>
        11. Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, O righteous,
        and shout for joy, all you upright in heart!<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 32 is a psalm of confession, forgiveness, and the blessings that come from acknowledging one's sin before the Lord. It highlights the joy and freedom found in repentance and trusting in God's steadfast love and guidance.</h4>
            The psalm begins by proclaiming the blessedness of those whose transgressions are forgiven and whose sins are covered. They are blessed because the Lord does not count their iniquity, and their spirits are free from deceit.<br><br>

            The psalmist reflects on the consequences of keeping silent about their sin. They experienced physical and emotional anguish, with their bones wasting away and groaning throughout the day. The heavy hand of the Lord was upon them, causing their strength to dry up like the heat of summer.<br><br>
            
            However, the psalmist found relief and restoration by acknowledging their sin before God and confessing their transgressions. They did not try to cover up their iniquity but openly admitted it to the Lord. As a result, God forgave their sin and removed its guilt. The psalmist emphasizes this turnaround with the word "Selah," inviting reflection and meditation.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist then calls upon the godly to offer prayer to God, recognizing His readiness to be found and to provide refuge and deliverance. They find solace in God, who preserves them from trouble and surrounds them with shouts of deliverance.<br><br>
            
            God assures the psalmist of His guidance and counsel, promising to instruct and teach them in the way they should go. He watches over them with His eye, providing ongoing guidance and correction. The psalmist urges the listener not to be stubborn and unresponsive like a horse or mule that requires external control to stay near, but to willingly follow God's leading.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes by contrasting the sorrows of the wicked with the steadfast love that surrounds those who trust in the Lord. The righteous are encouraged to be glad, rejoice, and shout for joy, for their hearts are upright before God.<br><br></p>
