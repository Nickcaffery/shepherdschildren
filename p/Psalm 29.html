        1. Ascribe to the Lord, O heavenly beings,
        ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.<br><br>
        2. Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;
        worship the Lord in the splendor of holiness.<br><br>
        
        3. The voice of the Lord is over the waters;
        the God of glory thunders,
        the Lord, over many waters.<br><br>
        4. The voice of the Lord is powerful;
        the voice of the Lord is full of majesty.<br><br>
        
        5. The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars;
        the Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon.<br><br>
        6. He makes Lebanon to skip like a calf,
        and Sirion like a young wild ox.<br><br>
        
        7. The voice of the Lord flashes forth flames of fire.<br><br>
        8. The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness;
        the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.<br><br>
        
        9. The voice of the Lord makes the deer give birth
        and strips the forests bare,
        and in his temple all cry, "Glory!"<br><br>
        
        10. The Lord sits enthroned over the flood;
        the Lord sits enthroned as king forever.<br><br>
        11. May the Lord give strength to his people!
        May the Lord bless his people with peace!<br><br></p>
