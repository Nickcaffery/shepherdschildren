        1. Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;
        his steadfast love endures forever!<br><br>
        
        2. Let Israel say,
        "His steadfast love endures forever."<br><br>
        3. Let the house of Aaron say,
        "His steadfast love endures forever."<br><br>
        4. Let those who fear the Lord say,
        "His steadfast love endures forever."<br><br>
        
        5. Out of my distress, I called on the Lord;
        the Lord answered me and set me free.<br><br>
        6. The Lord is on my side; I will not fear.
        What can man do to me?<br><br>
        7. The Lord is on my side as my helper;
        I shall look in triumph on those who hate me.<br><br>
        
        8. It is better to take refuge in the Lord
        than to trust in man.<br><br>
        9. It is better to take refuge in the Lord
        than to trust in princes.<br><br>
        
        10. All nations surrounded me;
        in the name of the Lord, I cut them off!<br><br>
        11. They surrounded me, surrounded me on every side;
        in the name of the Lord, I cut them off!<br><br>
        12. They surrounded me like bees;
        they went out like a fire among thorns;
        in the name of the Lord, I cut them off!<br><br>
        
        13. I was pushed hard, so that I was falling,
        but the Lord helped me.<br><br>
        14. The Lord is my strength and my song;
        he has become my salvation.<br><br>
        
        15. Glad songs of salvation
        are in the tents of the righteous:
        "The right hand of the Lord does valiantly,<br><br>
        16. the right hand of the Lord exalts,
        the right hand of the Lord does valiantly!"<br><br>
        
        17. I shall not die, but I shall live,
        and recount the deeds of the Lord.<br><br>
        18. The Lord has disciplined me severely,
        but he has not given me over to death.<br><br>
        
        19. Open to me the gates of righteousness,
        that I may enter through them
        and give thanks to the Lord.<br><br>
        20. This is the gate of the Lord;
        the righteous shall enter through it.<br><br>
        21. I thank you that you have answered me
        and have become my salvation.<br><br>
        22. The stone that the builders rejected
        has become the cornerstone.<br><br>
        23. This is the Lord's doing;
        it is marvelous in our eyes.<br><br>
        24. This is the day that the Lord has made;
        let us rejoice and be glad in it.<br><br>
        
        25. Save us, we pray, O Lord!
        O Lord, we pray, give us success!<br><br>
        
        26. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
        We bless you from the house of the Lord.<br><br>
        27. The Lord is God,
        and he has made his light to shine upon us.
        Bind the festal sacrifice with cords,
        up to the horns of the altar!<br><br>
        
        28. You are my God, and I will give thanks to you;
        you are my God; I will extol you.<br><br>
        29. Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;
        for his steadfast love endures forever!<br><br></p>
