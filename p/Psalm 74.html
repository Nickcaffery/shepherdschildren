        1. O God, why do you cast us off forever?
        Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?<br><br>
        2. Remember your congregation, which you have purchased of old,
        which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your heritage!
        Remember Mount Zion, where you have dwelt.<br><br>
        3. Direct your steps to the perpetual ruins;
        the enemy has destroyed everything in the sanctuary!<br><br>
        
        4. Your foes have roared in the midst of your meeting place;
        they set up their own signs for signs.<br><br>
        5. They were like those who swing axes
        in a forest of trees.<br><br>
        6. And all its carved wood
        they broke down with hatchets and hammers.<br><br>
        7. They set your sanctuary on fire;
        they profaned the dwelling place of your name,
        bringing it down to the ground.<br><br>
        8. They said to themselves, "We will utterly subdue them";
        they burned all the meeting places of God in the land.<br><br>
        
        9. We do not see our signs;
        there is no longer any prophet,
        and there is none among us who knows how long.<br><br>
        10. How long, O God, is the foe to scoff?
        Is the enemy to revile your name forever?<br><br>
        11. Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand?
        Take it from the fold of your garment and destroy them!<br><br>
        
        12. Yet God my King is from of old,
        working salvation in the midst of the earth.<br><br>
        13. You divided the sea by your might;
        you broke the heads of the sea monsters on the waters.<br><br>
        14. You crushed the heads of Leviathan;
        you gave him as food for the creatures of the wilderness.<br><br>
        15. You split open springs and brooks;
        you dried up ever-flowing streams.<br><br>
        16. Yours is the day, yours also the night;
        you have established the heavenly lights and the sun.<br><br>
        17. You have fixed all the boundaries of the earth;
        you have made summer and winter.<br><br>
        
        18. Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy scoffs,
        and a foolish people reviles your name.<br><br>
        19. Do not deliver the soul of your dove to the wild beasts;
        do not forget the life of your poor forever.<br><br>
        
        20. Have regard for the covenant,
        for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.<br><br>
        21. Let not the downtrodden turn back in shame;
        let the poor and needy praise your name.<br><br>
        
        22. Arise, O God, defend your cause;
        remember how the foolish scoff at you all the day!<br><br>
        23. Do not forget the clamor of your foes,
        the uproar of those who rise against you, which goes up continually!<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 74 is a communal lament expressing the distress and outcry of the people over the destruction of the sanctuary and the desecration of God's dwelling place. The psalmist pleads for God's intervention, recalls God's past acts of deliverance, and implores Him to remember the covenant and defend His cause.</h4>
            The psalm begins with the people questioning why God seems to have cast them off and expressing their frustration at His anger against them. They urge God to remember His congregation, which He has redeemed and purchased as His heritage. They implore Him to recall Mount Zion, the place where He has dwelt.<br><br>

            The psalmist describes the extent of the destruction, as the enemy has laid waste to the sanctuary and defiled it. The foes have set up their own signs and symbols, boasting in their triumph. They have destroyed the carved woodwork, set the sanctuary on fire, and profaned the dwelling place of God's name. They have burned all the meeting places of God in the land.<br><br>
            
            The people lament the absence of signs and prophets, feeling a loss of divine guidance and unsure of how long the devastation will continue. They call upon God to take action against their enemies, to put an end to their scoffing and reviling of His name.<br><br>
            
            The psalm takes a turn as the psalmist remembers God's mighty acts in the past. They recall how God divided the sea, defeated sea monsters, crushed Leviathan, and demonstrated His power over creation. They acknowledge God's sovereignty over day and night, the establishment of heavenly lights, and His authority over the boundaries of the earth and the changing seasons.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist appeals to God to remember the enemy's scoffing and the reviling of His name. They implore Him not to deliver the soul of His dove (referring to the people) to the wild beasts, and not to forget the life of the poor forever.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist calls upon God to have regard for the covenant, as the dark places of the land are filled with violence and oppression. They urge God not to let the downtrodden turn back in shame, but rather let the poor and needy praise His name.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a plea for God to arise and defend His cause. The psalmist implores God to remember the ongoing clamor and uproar of His foes, which continually rise against Him.<br><br></p>
