        1. Blessed is the one who considers the poor!
        In the day of trouble, the Lord delivers him;<br><br>
        2. the Lord protects him and keeps him alive;
        he is called blessed in the land;
        you do not give him up to the will of his enemies.<br><br>
        3. The Lord sustains him on his sickbed;
        in his illness, you restore him to full health.<br><br>
        
        4. As for me, I said, "O Lord, be gracious to me;
        heal me, for I have sinned against you!"<br><br>
        5. My enemies say of me in malice,
        "When will he die, and his name perish?"<br><br>
        6. And when one comes to see me, he utters empty words,
        while his heart gathers iniquity;
        when he goes out, he tells it abroad.<br><br>
        7. All who hate me whisper together about me;
        they imagine the worst for me.<br><br>
        
        8. They say, "A deadly thing is poured out on him;
        he will not rise again from where he lies."<br><br>
        9. Even my close friend in whom I trusted,
        who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me.<br><br>
        10. But you, O Lord, be gracious to me,
        and raise me up, that I may repay them!<br><br>
        
        11. By this I know that you delight in me:
        my enemy will not shout in triumph over me.<br><br>
        12. But you have upheld me because of my integrity,
        and set me in your presence forever.<br><br>
        
        13. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
        from everlasting to everlasting!
        Amen and Amen.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 41 begins with a declaration of blessing upon those who consider and help the poor. The psalmist acknowledges that in the day of trouble, the Lord delivers and protects the one who cares for the needy. Such a person is called blessed in the land, and the Lord ensures that they are not handed over to their enemies' will. The Lord sustains and restores them to health even when they are sick.</h4>
            The psalmist then speaks from their own personal experience. They appeal to the Lord for grace and healing, recognizing their own sins. They express the malicious words and intentions of their enemies who desire their demise and the destruction of their name. Even those who come to visit them pretend to be concerned but actually gather information to spread against them. All those who hate the psalmist conspire and imagine the worst for them.<br><br>

            The psalmist describes the slanderous words spoken about them, suggesting that a deadly disease has struck them and that they will never rise again. They also express the betrayal of a close friend whom they trusted and shared bread with, who has now turned against them. However, in the midst of these adversities, the psalmist appeals to the Lord for grace and asks to be raised up to repay their enemies.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist finds assurance in the fact that their enemies will not shout in triumph over them. They believe that the Lord delights in them and upholds them because of their integrity. They trust in God's presence and everlasting support.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a doxology, blessing the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.<br><br></p>
