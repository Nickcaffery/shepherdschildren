        1. I love the Lord, because he has heard
        my voice and my pleas for mercy.<br><br>
        2. Because he inclined his ear to me,
        therefore I will call on him as long as I live.<br><br>
        
        3. The snares of death encompassed me;
        the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me;
        I suffered distress and anguish.<br><br>
        4. Then I called on the name of the Lord:
        "O Lord, I pray, deliver my soul!"<br><br>
        
        5. Gracious is the Lord, and righteous;
        our God is merciful.<br><br>
        6. The Lord preserves the simple;
        when I was brought low, he saved me.<br><br>
        7. Return, O my soul, to your rest;
        for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.<br><br>
        
        8. For you have delivered my soul from death,
        my eyes from tears,
        my feet from stumbling;<br><br>
        9. I will walk before the Lord
        in the land of the living.<br><br>
        
        10. I believed, even when I spoke,
        "I am greatly afflicted";<br><br>
        11. I said in my alarm,
        "All mankind are liars."<br><br>
        
        12. What shall I render to the Lord
        for all his benefits to me?<br><br>
        13. I will lift up the cup of salvation
        and call on the name of the Lord,<br><br>
        14. I will pay my vows to the Lord
        in the presence of all his people.<br><br>
        
        15. Precious in the sight of the Lord
        is the death of his saints.<br><br>
        16. O Lord, I am your servant;
        I am your servant, the son of your maidservant.
        You have loosed my bonds.<br><br>
        17. I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving
        and call on the name of the Lord.<br><br>
        18. I will pay my vows to the Lord
        in the presence of all his people,<br><br>
        19. in the courts of the house of the Lord,
        in your midst, O Jerusalem.
        Praise the Lord!<br><br></p>
