        <p><h4>Psalm 20 is a prayer for the success and protection of the king and the people of Israel. It expresses trust in God's intervention and deliverance, highlighting the contrast between relying on earthly strength versus trusting in the Lord.</h4>
            The psalm begins with a prayer for the Lord to answer in times of trouble and to provide protection. The psalmist calls upon the God of Jacob, the God of the Israelites, to send help and support from His sanctuary in Zion. They also mention the offerings and sacrifices made to God, asking for favor and remembrance of these acts of worship.<br><br>

            The psalmist then prays for God to grant the heart's desire of the king and to fulfill all their plans. They anticipate rejoicing over the king's salvation and raise banners in the name of their God. The psalmist asks for the Lord to answer all the petitions and prayers of the king and the people.<br><br>
            
            Verse 6 affirms the psalmist's confidence that the Lord saves His anointed one, likely referring to the king. The psalmist expects God to answer the anointed one from His holy heaven with His mighty right hand.<br><br>
            
            In verse 7, a contrast is drawn between those who trust in chariots and horses, symbols of human strength and power, and those who trust in the name of the Lord their God. The psalmist declares that while others may collapse and fall, those who trust in the Lord will rise and stand upright.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a plea for the Lord to save the king and to answer the people's call for help.<br><br></p>
