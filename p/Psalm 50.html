        1. The Mighty One, God the Lord,
        speaks and summons the earth
        from the rising of the sun to its setting.<br><br>
        2. Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
        God shines forth.<br><br>
        3. Our God comes; he does not keep silence;
        before him is a devouring fire,
        around him a mighty tempest.<br><br>
        4. He calls to the heavens above
        and to the earth, that he may judge his people:<br><br>
        5. "Gather to me my faithful ones,
        who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!"<br><br>
        6. The heavens declare his righteousness,
        for God himself is judge! Selah<br><br>
        
        7. "Hear, O my people, and I will speak;
        O Israel, I will testify against you.
        I am God, your God.<br><br>
        8. Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you;
        your burnt offerings are continually before me.<br><br>
        9. I will not accept a bull from your house
        or goats from your folds.<br><br>
        10. For every beast of the forest is mine,
        the cattle on a thousand hills.<br><br>
        11. I know all the birds of the hills,
        and all that moves in the field is mine.<br><br>
        
        12. "If I were hungry, I would not tell you,
        for the world and its fullness are mine.<br><br>
        13. Do I eat the flesh of bulls
        or drink the blood of goats?<br><br>
        14. Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving,
        and perform your vows to the Most High,<br><br>
        15. and call upon me in the day of trouble;
        I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me."<br><br>
        
        16. But to the wicked God says:
        "What right have you to recite my statutes
        or take my covenant on your lips?<br><br>
        17. For you hate discipline,
        and you cast my words behind you.<br><br>
        18. If you see a thief, you are pleased with him,
        and you keep company with adulterers.<br><br>
        
        19. "You give your mouth free rein for evil,
        and your tongue frames deceit.<br><br>
        20. You sit and speak against your brother;
        you slander your own mother's son.<br><br>
        21. These things you have done, and I have been silent;
        you thought that I was one like yourself.
        But now I rebuke you and lay the charge before you.<br><br>
        
        22. "Mark this, then, you who forget God,
        lest I tear you apart, and there be none to deliver!<br><br>
        23. The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me;
        to one who orders his way rightly
        I will show the salvation of God!"<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 50 is a psalm of judgment and a call for sincere worship. The psalm begins with the proclamation of God's majesty and power. God speaks and summons the entire earth, shining forth from Zion. His presence is described as a devouring fire and a mighty tempest. He calls the heavens and the earth as witnesses for the judgment of His people.</h4>
            God addresses His people, reminding them that He is their God and testifying against them. He rebukes them, not for their sacrifices, which are continually offered, but for their lack of true heart devotion. God declares that He does not need their animal offerings because all creation belongs to Him. He calls for a sacrifice of thanksgiving and the fulfillment of vows made to Him. He assures them that if they call upon Him in times of trouble, He will deliver them and be glorified.<br><br>

            God then turns His attention to the wicked. He exposes their hypocrisy, as they recite His statutes and claim His covenant but harbor hatred, engage in deceit, slander, and associate with evil. God confronts their unrighteousness and warns them of impending judgment.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a warning to those who forget God. God urges them to turn from their wicked ways, reminding them that He is the ultimate judge who can tear them apart. He encourages the offering of thanksgiving as a sacrifice and the ordering of one's ways rightly. To those who do so, God promises to show His salvation.<br><br></p>    
        <p><h4>Psalm 50 calls for sincere and wholehearted worship, emphasizing that God desires genuine devotion and righteousness rather than superficial religious rituals. It highlights God's role as the righteous judge who examines the hearts and actions of His people. The psalm serves as a reminder to align one's life with God's commands, offer thanksgiving, and trust in His deliverance.</h4></p>
