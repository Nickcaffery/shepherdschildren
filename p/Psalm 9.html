    <p class="sttext">
      1. I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart;
I will recount all of your wonderful deeds.<br><br>
2. I will be glad and exult in you;
I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.<br><br>

3. When my enemies turn back,
they stumble and perish before your presence.<br><br>
4. For you have maintained my just cause;
you have sat on the throne, giving righteous judgment.<br><br>

5. You have rebuked the nations; you have made the wicked perish;
you have blotted out their name forever and ever.<br><br>
6. The enemy came to an end in everlasting ruins;
their cities you rooted out;
the very memory of them has perished.<br><br>

7. But the Lord sits enthroned forever;
he has established his throne for justice,<br><br>
8. and he judges the world with righteousness;
he judges the peoples with uprightness.<br><br>

9. The Lord is a stronghold for the oppressed,
a stronghold in times of trouble.<br><br>
10. And those who know your name put their trust in you,
for you, O Lord, have not forsaken those who seek you.<br><br>

11. Sing praises to the Lord, who sits enthroned in Zion!
Tell among the peoples his deeds!<br><br>
12. For he who avenges blood is mindful of them;
he does not forget the cry of the afflicted.<br><br>

13. Be gracious to me, O Lord!
See my affliction from those who hate me,
O you who lift me up from the gates of death,<br><br>
14. that I may recount all your praises,
that in the gates of the daughter of Zion
I may rejoice in your salvation.<br><br>

15. The nations have sunk in the pit that they made;
in the net that they hid, their own foot has been caught.<br><br>
16. The Lord has made himself known; he has executed judgment;
the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands. Higgaion. Selah<br><br>

17. The wicked shall return to Sheol,
all the nations that forget God.<br><br>

18. For the needy shall not always be forgotten,
and the hope of the poor shall not perish forever.<br><br>

19. Arise, O Lord! Let not man prevail;
let the nations be judged before you!<br><br>
20. Put them in fear, O Lord!
Let the nations know that they are but men! Selah<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 9 is a song of praise and thanksgiving, attributed to King David. It celebrates God's righteous judgment, deliverance, and protection for the oppressed, as well as His faithfulness in hearing the cries of the afflicted.</h4>
            The psalm begins with a declaration of wholehearted thanks and a determination to recount all of God's wonderful deeds. The psalmist expresses gladness and exultation in the Lord, praising His name.<br><br>

            The psalmist testifies to the defeat and destruction of their enemies before the Lord's presence. They acknowledge that God has maintained their just cause and sat on the throne, executing righteous judgment.<br><br>
            
            God is portrayed as one who rebukes nations, causing the wicked to perish and their names to be blotted out forever. The psalmist describes the complete destruction of the enemy, with their cities uprooted and their memory erased.<br><br>
            
            The psalm emphasizes that the Lord sits enthroned forever, establishing His throne for justice. He judges the world and its peoples with righteousness and uprightness.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist declares that the Lord is a stronghold for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. Those who know God's name put their trust in Him, for He does not forsake those who seek Him.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist calls for praises to be sung to the Lord, encouraging the recounting of His deeds among the peoples. God is mindful of the afflicted and their cries for justice. The psalmist appeals for God's grace and deliverance from those who hate them, so that they may rejoice in God's salvation.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist proclaims that the wicked will be caught in their own traps and will face the consequences of their actions. They will return to Sheol, and all nations that forget God will be judged.<br><br>
            
            In the final verses, the psalmist affirms that the needy will not be forgotten, and the hope of the poor will not perish. They call upon the Lord to arise and let not man prevail. The psalmist desires that the nations fear God and recognize their own humanity before Him.<br><br></p>
