        1. O Lord, God of my salvation,
        I cry out day and night before you.<br><br>
        2. Let my prayer come before you;
        incline your ear to my cry!<br><br>
        
        3. For my soul is full of troubles,
        and my life draws near to Sheol.<br><br>
        4. I am counted among those who go down to the pit;
        I am a man who has no strength,<br><br>
        5. like one set loose among the dead,
        like the slain that lie in the grave,
        like those whom you remember no more,
        for they are cut off from your hand.<br><br>
        6. You have put me in the depths of the pit,
        in the regions dark and deep.<br><br>
        7. Your wrath lies heavy upon me,
        and you overwhelm me with all your waves. Selah<br><br>
        
        8. You have caused my companions to shun me;
        you have made me a horror to them.
        I am shut in so that I cannot escape;<br><br>
        9. my eye grows dim through sorrow.
        Every day I call upon you, O Lord;
        I spread out my hands to you.<br><br>
        10. Do you work wonders for the dead?
        Do the departed rise up to praise you? Selah<br><br>
        11. Is your steadfast love declared in the grave,
        or your faithfulness in Abaddon?<br><br>
        12. Are your wonders known in the darkness,
        or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?<br><br>
        
        13. But I, O Lord, cry to you;
        in the morning my prayer comes before you.<br><br>
        14. O Lord, why do you cast my soul away?
        Why do you hide your face from me?<br><br>
        15. Afflicted and close to death from my youth up,
        I suffer your terrors; I am helpless.<br><br>
        16. Your wrath has swept over me;
        your dreadful assaults destroy me.<br><br>
        17. They surround me like a flood all day long;
        they close in on me together.<br><br>
        18. You have caused my beloved and my friend to shun me;
        my companions have become darkness.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 88 is a deeply mournful and sorrowful psalm, expressing the anguish and desperation of the psalmist. It is a lamentation filled with feelings of abandonment and despair.</h4>
            The psalmist cries out to God, appealing for His attention and intervention. They acknowledge God as the Lord, the God of their salvation, and express their continuous crying and praying before Him day and night.<br><br>

            The psalmist describes their soul as being full of troubles, and their life as drawing near to Sheol, the realm of the dead. They feel weak and helpless, as if they are already counted among those who go down to the pit. They feel disconnected and forgotten by God, as if they are cut off from His hand. They describe being in the depths of the pit, overwhelmed by God's wrath and waves of affliction.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist shares how their companions have shunned them, considering them a horror. They feel trapped and unable to escape their affliction. Sorrow has dimmed their eyes, and every day they call upon the Lord, spreading out their hands in prayer. They question if God works wonders for the dead or if the departed rise to praise Him. They wonder if God's steadfast love and faithfulness can be declared in the grave or in the realm of the dead.<br><br>
            
            Despite their deep anguish, the psalmist continues to cry out to God in the morning, presenting their prayers before Him. They question why God has cast their soul away and hidden His face from them. They describe a lifelong experience of affliction and closeness to death, suffering God's terrors and feeling helpless. They express the overwhelming force of God's wrath and the destructive assaults they experience. The psalmist feels surrounded by adversity, as if a flood is closing in on them all day long. Their beloved ones and friends have turned away, and their companions have become darkness.<br><br></p>
