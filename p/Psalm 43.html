        1. Vindicate me, O God, and defend my cause
        against an ungodly people,
        from the deceitful and unjust man
        deliver me!<br><br>
        2. For you are the God in whom I take refuge;
        why have you rejected me?
        Why do I go about mourning
        because of the oppression of the enemy?<br><br>
        
        3. Send out your light and your truth;
        let them lead me;
        let them bring me to your holy hill
        and to your dwelling!<br><br>
        4. Then I will go to the altar of God,
        to God my exceeding joy,
        and I will praise you with the lyre,
        O God, my God.<br><br>
        
        5. Why are you cast down, O my soul,
        and why are you in turmoil within me?
        Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,
        my salvation and my God.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 43 is closely connected to Psalm 42, often considered as a continuation of the same prayer. The psalmist cries out to God for vindication and defense against ungodly and deceitful people. They express a deep desire for deliverance from oppression and question why they feel rejected and mournful.</h4>
            The psalmist appeals to God as their refuge, acknowledging Him as the God in whom they find safety and security. They express their longing for God's intervention and restoration. The psalmist implores God to send out His light and truth, leading them to His holy hill and dwelling place.<br><br>

            The psalmist anticipates the opportunity to approach God's altar, experiencing great joy and praising Him with a lyre. They long to worship and offer sacrifices to God, expressing their devotion and love for Him.<br><br>
            
            Once again, the psalmist questions their troubled and cast-down soul, asking why they are in turmoil. They encourage themselves to hope in God and express confidence that they will again praise Him, recognizing Him as their salvation and their God.<br><br></p>
