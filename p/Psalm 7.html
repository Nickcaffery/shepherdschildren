      1. O Lord my God, in you do I take refuge;
save me from all my pursuers and deliver me,<br><br>
2. lest like a lion they tear my soul apart,
rending it in pieces, with none to deliver.<br><br>

3. O Lord my God, if I have done this,
if there is wrong in my hands,<br><br>
4. if I have repaid my friend with evil
or plundered my enemy without cause,<br><br>
5. let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it,
and let him trample my life to the ground
and lay my glory in the dust. Selah<br><br>

6. Arise, O Lord, in your anger;
lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies;
awake for me; you have appointed a judgment.<br><br>
7. Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about you;
over it return on high.<br><br>
8. The Lord judges the peoples;
judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness
and according to the integrity that is in me.<br><br>
9. Oh, let the evil of the wicked come to an end,
and may you establish the righteousâ€”
you who test the minds and hearts,
O righteous God!<br><br>
10. My shield is with God,
who saves the upright in heart.<br><br>
11. God is a righteous judge,
and a God who feels indignation every day.<br><br>

12. If a man does not repent, God will whet his sword;
he has bent and readied his bow;<br><br>
13. he has prepared for him his deadly weapons,
making his arrows fiery shafts.<br><br>
14. Behold, the wicked man conceives evil
and is pregnant with mischief
and gives birth to lies.<br><br>
15. He makes a pit, digging it out,
and falls into the hole that he has made.<br><br>
16. His mischief returns upon his own head,
and on his own skull his violence descends.<br><br>

17. I will give to the Lord the thanks due to his righteousness,
and I will sing praise to the name of the Lord, the Most High.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 7 is attributed to King David and is referred to as a "shiggaion," which is a term whose exact meaning is uncertain. It is a prayer seeking God's protection, deliverance, and justice against enemies who pursue and accuse him unjustly.</h4>
            David begins by taking refuge in the Lord, asking for deliverance from his pursuers. He compares his enemies to a lion that threatens to tear his soul apart, and he seeks God's intervention to save him.<br><br>

            David acknowledges that if he has done wrong, if he has repaid evil for good or treated his enemy unjustly, he is willing to face the consequences. He prays that if he is guilty, his enemies will overtake him and bring him down to the dust.<br><br>
            
            David then calls upon the Lord to rise in anger against his enemies. He asks God to gather the assembly of the peoples and return to the heights to judge them. David appeals to God to judge him according to his righteousness and integrity, asking for the wicked to be brought to an end and the righteous to be established.<br><br>
            
            David affirms his trust in God as his shield and protector of the upright in heart. He acknowledges God as a righteous judge who feels indignation against evil every day.<br><br>
            
            The psalm describes the consequences that await the unrepentant wicked. God sharpens His sword and prepares deadly weapons against them. The wicked conceive evil, give birth to lies, and ultimately fall into the traps they have set. Their mischief and violence recoil upon themselves.<br><br>
            
            In the conclusion, David expresses his gratitude and praises the Lord for His righteousness. He recognizes God as the Most High and declares his commitment to offer thanks and sing praises to Him.<br><br></p>    
        <p><h4>Psalm 7 reflects David's plea for God's protection, justice, and deliverance against his enemies. It emphasizes trust in God's righteousness and His role as a just judge who will vindicate the righteous and bring consequences upon the wicked.</h4></p>
