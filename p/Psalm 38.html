        1. O Lord, rebuke me not in your anger,
        nor discipline me in your wrath!<br><br>
        2. For your arrows have sunk into me,
        and your hand has come down on me.<br><br>
        
        3. There is no soundness in my flesh
        because of your indignation;
        there is no health in my bones
        because of my sin.<br><br>
        4. For my iniquities have gone over my head;
        like a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.<br><br>
        
        5. My wounds stink and fester
        because of my foolishness,<br><br>
        6. I am utterly bowed down and prostrate;
        all the day I go about mourning.<br><br>
        7. For my sides are filled with burning,
        and there is no soundness in my flesh.<br><br>
        8. I am feeble and crushed;
        I groan because of the tumult of my heart.<br><br>
        
        9. O Lord, all my longing is before you;
        my sighing is not hidden from you.<br><br>
        10. My heart throbs; my strength fails me,
        and the light of my eyesâ€”it also has gone from me.<br><br>
        11. My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague,
        and my nearest kin stand far off.<br><br>
        
        12. Those who seek my life lay their snares;
        those who seek my hurt speak of ruin
        and meditate treachery all day long.<br><br>
        
        13. But I am like a deaf man; I do not hear,
        like a mute man who does not open his mouth.<br><br>
        14. I have become like a man who does not hear
        and in whose mouth are no rebukes.<br><br>
        
        15. But for you, O Lord, do I wait;
        it is you, O Lord my God, who will answer.<br><br>
        16. For I said, "Only let them not rejoice over me,
        who boast against me when my foot slips!"<br><br>
        
        17. For I am ready to fall,
        and my pain is ever before me.<br><br>
        18. I confess my iniquity;
        I am sorry for my sin.<br><br>
        19. But my foes are vigorous, they are mighty,
        and many are those who hate me wrongfully.<br><br>
        20. Those who render me evil for good
        accuse me because I follow after good.<br><br>
        
        21. Do not forsake me, O Lord!
        O my God, be not far from me!
        22 Make haste to help me,
        O Lord, my salvation!<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 38 is a lamentation and prayer for deliverance from affliction and the consequences of sin. The psalmist acknowledges their sin and the physical and emotional distress it has caused. They appeal to the Lord for mercy and help, expressing their longing for God's intervention and protection.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by pleading with the Lord not to rebuke or discipline them in anger or wrath. They describe feeling the weight of God's arrows and the heaviness of His hand upon them.<br><br>

            The psalmist acknowledges the physical and spiritual toll of their sin. They confess that there is no soundness in their flesh and bones due to God's indignation and their own iniquities. The burden of their sin is overwhelming and causes wounds, stench, and festering. They are bowed down, mourning, and filled with burning. Their heart is in turmoil, and they groan under its weight.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist recognizes that the Lord is aware of their longing and sighing, and nothing is hidden from Him. Their heart throbs, and their strength fails. Their friends and companions distance themselves, and even their closest relatives keep their distance.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist laments the plots and treachery of those who seek their life and harm. They feel helpless, unable to hear or speak out against their enemies' accusations.<br><br>
            
            Nevertheless, the psalmist puts their hope in the Lord, waiting for His answer. They ask the Lord not to let their enemies rejoice over their downfall. They acknowledge their readiness to fall and the constant presence of pain. They confess their iniquity and express sorrow for their sin, while their foes remain strong, numerous, and wrongfully hateful. They are accused for following after good and receiving evil in return.<br><br>
            
            In their distress, the psalmist pleads for the Lord not to forsake them and to be near, quickly coming to their aid as their salvation.<br><br></p>
