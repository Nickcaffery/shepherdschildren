        <p><h4>Psalm 15 is a psalm that explores the qualities and actions of a person who is worthy to dwell in the presence of the Lord. It outlines the characteristics of a righteous individual and emphasizes the importance of integrity and righteous living.</h4>
            The psalm begins with a question: Who is worthy to sojourn in the Lord's tent and dwell on His holy hill? This poses the inquiry about the kind of person who is acceptable to have a close relationship with God.<br><br>

            Verse 2 provides a list of virtuous qualities that describe such an individual. This person walks blamelessly, meaning they strive to live a righteous and upright life. They do what is right, act with integrity, and speak truth in their heart. The emphasis is on sincerity and honesty in both words and intentions.<br><br>
            
            Verse 3 highlights how this person treats others. They do not engage in slander or speak evil against their neighbor. They refuse to take up a reproach against their friend, showing loyalty and respect towards others.<br><br>
            
            Verse 4 reflects their discernment in judgment. They despise vile or wicked individuals, but honor and value those who fear the Lord. They recognize and esteem those who live in reverence and obedience to God.<br><br>
            
            Verse 5 continues with the characteristics of a righteous individual. They keep their promises and commitments, even if it brings personal hardship. They do not exploit others or engage in usury, and they do not accept bribes to pervert justice.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes by stating that the person who embodies these qualities will not be moved or shaken. They will experience stability and security in their relationship with God.<br><br></p>
