        1. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,
        you who lead Joseph like a flock.
        You who are enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth.<br><br>
        2. Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh,
        stir up your might
        and come to save us!<br><br>
        
        3. Restore us, O God;
        let your face shine, that we may be saved!<br><br>
        
        4. O Lord God of hosts,
        how long will you be angry with your people's prayers?<br><br>
        5. You have fed them with the bread of tears
        and given them tears to drink in full measure.<br><br>
        6. You make us an object of contention for our neighbors,
        and our enemies laugh among themselves.<br><br>
        
        7. Restore us, O God of hosts;
        let your face shine, that we may be saved!<br><br>
        
        8. You brought a vine out of Egypt;
        you drove out the nations and planted it.<br><br>
        9. You cleared the ground for it;
        it took deep root and filled the land.<br><br>
        10. The mountains were covered with its shade,
        the mighty cedars with its branches.<br><br>
        11. It sent out its branches to the sea
        and its shoots to the River.<br><br>
        12. Why then have you broken down its walls,<br><br>
        13. The boar from the forest ravages it,
        and all that move in the field feed on it.<br><br>
        
        14. Turn again, O God of hosts!
        Look down from heaven, and see;
        have regard for this vine,<br><br>
        15. the stock that your right hand planted,<br><br>
        16. They have burned it with fire; they have cut it down;
        may they perish at the rebuke of your face!<br><br>
        17. But let your hand be on the man of your right hand,
        the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself!<br><br>
        18. Then we shall not turn back from you;
        give us life, and we will call upon your name!<br><br>
        
        19. Restore us, O Lord God of hosts!
        Let your face shine, that we may be saved!<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 80 is a plea for God's restoration and salvation. The psalmist calls upon God, the Shepherd of Israel, to hear their cry and come to their aid. They express a desire for God's face to shine upon them, signifying His favor and blessing.</h4>
            The psalmist acknowledges God's anger and the suffering that the people have experienced. They describe how the people have been fed with the bread of tears and have drunk tears in full measure. They have become a source of contention among their neighbors, and their enemies mock them.<br><br>

            The psalmist continues to plead for restoration, asking God to shine His face upon them once again for their salvation. They recall how God brought the people out of Egypt like a vine and cleared the land for them. The vine took root and spread, providing shade and strength. However, now the walls of the vine have been broken down, and it has been ravaged by wild animals and those who feed in the field.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist implores God to turn His attention to the situation. They ask God to look down from heaven, take notice of the vine that His right hand planted, and intervene on its behalf. They desire the destruction and perishing of those who have burned and cut down the vine.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist expresses the hope that God's hand would be upon the man of His right hand, the son of man whom God has made strong. They recognize the need for God's intervention and empowerment for the people to remain faithful and continue calling upon His name.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with another plea for restoration and salvation. The psalmist reiterates the request for God's face to shine upon them, signifying His favor and blessing.<br><br></p>
