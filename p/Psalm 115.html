        1. Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory,
        for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness!<br><br>
        
        2. Why should the nations say,
        "Where is their God?"<br><br>
        3. Our God is in the heavens;
        he does all that he pleases.<br><br>
        
        4. Their idols are silver and gold,
        the work of human hands.<br><br>
        5. They have mouths, but do not speak;
        eyes, but do not see.<br><br>
        6. They have ears, but do not hear;
        noses, but do not smell.<br><br>
        7. They have hands, but do not feel;
        feet, but do not walk;
        they do not make a sound in their throat.<br><br>
        8. Those who make them become like them;
        so do all who trust in them.<br><br>
        
        9. O Israel, trust in the Lord!
        He is their help and their shield.<br><br>
        10. O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord!
        He is their help and their shield.<br><br>
        11. You who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord!
        He is their help and their shield.<br><br>
        
        12. The Lord has remembered us; he will bless us;
        he will bless the house of Israel;
        he will bless the house of Aaron;<br><br>
        13. he will bless those who fear the Lord,
        both the small and the great.<br><br>
        
        14. May the Lord give you increase,
        you and your children!<br><br>
        15. May you be blessed by the Lord,
        who made heaven and earth!<br><br>
        
        16. The heavens are the Lord's heavens,
        but the earth he has given to the children of man.<br><br>
        17. The dead do not praise the Lord,
        nor do any who go down into silence.<br><br>
        18. But we will bless the Lord
        from this time forth and forevermore.
        Praise the Lord!<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 115 is a psalm that glorifies the Lord and emphasizes the distinction between the true God and idols made by human hands. It calls for trust in the Lord and praises His faithfulness, blessing, and sovereignty.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by affirming that the glory belongs to the Lord, not to themselves. They attribute glory to the name of the Lord for His steadfast love and faithfulness. The psalmist acknowledges the divine character of the Lord and asserts that He is in the heavens and does as He pleases.<br><br>

            The psalmist contrasts the true God with idols. They describe idols as made of silver and gold, the work of human hands. These idols are lifeless and incapable of speech, sight, hearing, smell, touch, or movement. The psalmist emphasizes the futility of trusting in such idols and warns that those who make and trust in them become like them, devoid of life and power.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist then calls upon Israel, the house of Aaron, and all who fear the Lord to trust in Him. They proclaim the Lord as their help and shield. They invite the people to place their confidence in the Lord's faithfulness and protective care.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist declares that the Lord has remembered His people and will bless them. This blessing extends to the house of Israel, the house of Aaron, and all who fear the Lord, regardless of their status or position. The psalmist prays for increase, blessings, and divine favor upon the people and their children.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist acknowledges the Lord's authority over the heavens, while entrusting the earth to the children of humanity. They point out that the dead do not praise the Lord, as they have entered into silence. However, the psalmist and the people declare their commitment to bless the Lord from that time forth and forevermore.<br><br></p>
