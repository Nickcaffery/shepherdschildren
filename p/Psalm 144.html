        1. Blessed be the Lord, my rock,
        who trains my hands for war,
        and my fingers for battle;<br><br>
        2. he is my steadfast love and my fortress,
        my stronghold and my deliverer,
        my shield and he in whom I take refuge,
        who subdues peoples under me.<br><br>
        
        3. O Lord, what is man that you regard him,
        or the son of man that you think of him?<br><br>
        4. Man is like a breath;
        his days are like a passing shadow.<br><br>
        
        5. Bow your heavens, O Lord, and come down!
        Touch the mountains so that they smoke!<br><br>
        6. Flash forth the lightning and scatter them;
        send out your arrows and rout them!<br><br>
        7. Stretch out your hand from on high;
        rescue me and deliver me from the many waters,
        from the hand of foreigners,<br><br>
        8. whose mouths speak lies
        and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.<br><br>
        
        9. I will sing a new song to you, O God;
        upon a ten-stringed harp I will play to you,<br><br>
        10. who gives victory to kings,
        who rescues David his servant from the cruel sword.<br><br>
        11. Rescue me and deliver me
        from the hand of foreigners,
        whose mouths speak lies
        and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.<br><br>
        
        12. May our sons in their youth
        be like plants full grown,
        our daughters like corner pillars
        cut for the structure of a palace;<br><br>
        13. may our granaries be full,
        providing all kinds of produce;
        may our sheep bring forth thousands
        and ten thousands in our fields;<br><br>
        14. may our cattle be heavy with young,
        suffering no mishap or failure in bearing;
        Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord!<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 144 is a song of praise and prayer to the Lord, acknowledging Him as the source of strength, refuge, and deliverance. The psalmist celebrates God's role as their rock, trainer for battle, and fortress. They recognize God's steadfast love, His ability to subdue peoples, and His protection as a shield.</h4>
            The psalmist contemplates the insignificance of humanity in comparison to the greatness of God. They acknowledge the fleeting nature of human existence, comparing it to a breath and a passing shadow.<br><br>

            The psalmist calls upon the Lord to come down, symbolized by bowing the heavens, and to manifest His power by touching the mountains and causing them to smoke. They plead for God's intervention, asking Him to send forth His lightning, arrows, and stretched-out hand to rescue and deliver them from foreign oppressors who speak lies and falsehood.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist expresses a desire to sing a new song to God, accompanied by a ten-stringed harp. They acknowledge God as the giver of victory to kings and the rescuer of David from the cruel sword. The psalmist seeks rescue and deliverance from the hand of foreign enemies whose mouths speak lies and whose right hand acts deceitfully.<br><br>
            
            In the final verses, the psalmist offers a prayer for blessings upon the nation. They desire for their sons to flourish like fully grown plants, and their daughters to be strong and graceful like corner pillars in a palace structure. They pray for abundance in their granaries, fruitful livestock, and overall prosperity. The psalm concludes by proclaiming the blessedness of the people whose God is the Lord.<br><br></p>
