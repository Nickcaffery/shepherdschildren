        1. He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High
        will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.<br><br>
        2. I will say to the Lord, "My refuge and my fortress,
        my God, in whom I trust."<br><br>
        
        3. For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler
        and from the deadly pestilence.<br><br>
        4. He will cover you with his pinions,
        and under his wings you will find refuge;
        his faithfulness is a shield and buckler.<br><br>
        5. You will not fear the terror of the night,
        nor the arrow that flies by day,<br><br>
        6. nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness,
        nor the destruction that wastes at noonday.<br><br>
        
        7. A thousand may fall at your side,
        ten thousand at your right hand,
        but it will not come near you.<br><br>
        8. You will only look with your eyes
        and see the recompense of the wicked.<br><br>
        
        9. Because you have made the Lord your dwelling place—
        the Most High, who is my refuge—<br><br>
        10. no evil shall be allowed to befall you,
        no plague come near your tent.<br><br>
        
        11. For he will command his angels concerning you
        to guard you in all your ways.<br><br>
        12. On their hands they will bear you up,
        lest you strike your foot against a stone.<br><br>
        13. You will tread on the lion and the adder;
        the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot.<br><br>
        
        14. "Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him;
        I will protect him, because he knows my name.<br><br>
        15. When he calls to me, I will answer him;
        I will be with him in trouble;
        I will rescue him and honor him.<br><br>
        16. With long life I will satisfy him
        and show him my salvation."<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 91 is a beautiful psalm that speaks of the protection, security, and faithfulness of God for those who trust in Him.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by proclaiming that the one who dwells in the shelter of the Most High and abides in the shadow of the Almighty will find refuge and security. They declare the Lord as their refuge, fortress, and God in whom they place their trust.<br><br>

            The psalmist asserts that God will deliver them from various dangers, including snares, deadly pestilence, and threats of terror. They depict God as a protective bird, covering them with His pinions and providing refuge under His wings. God's faithfulness is likened to a shield and buckler, offering protection and defense. The psalmist declares that they will not fear the terrors of the night, the dangers of the day, the lurking pestilence, or the destruction that strikes at noon.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist assures that even when thousands fall around them, the protection of the Lord will keep them safe. They will witness the recompense of the wicked, but no harm will befall them. They will see the justice of God firsthand.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist explains that those who have made the Lord their dwelling place, finding refuge in the Most High, will be shielded from evil and spared from plagues.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist affirms that God will command His angels to guard and protect the righteous in all their ways. The angels will bear them up, preventing them from stumbling or being harmed. The righteous will have victory over dangerous creatures and enemies, symbolized by the lion and the adder.<br><br>
            
            God speaks directly in the next section, promising deliverance, protection, and answered prayers for those who hold fast to Him in love and know His name. When they call on Him, He will answer and be with them in trouble. He will rescue and honor them, granting them long life and showing them His salvation.<br><br></p>
