        1. Have mercy on me, O God,
        according to your steadfast love;
        according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.<br><br>
        2. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,
        and cleanse me from my sin!<br><br>
        
        3. For I know my transgressions,
        and my sin is ever before me.<br><br>
        4. Against you, you only, have I sinned
        and done what is evil in your sight,
        so that you may be justified in your words
        and blameless in your judgment.<br><br>
        5. Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,
        and in sin did my mother conceive me.<br><br>
        6. Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being,
        and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart.<br><br>
        
        7. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;
        wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.<br><br>
        8. Let me hear joy and gladness;
        let the bones that you have broken rejoice.<br><br>
        9. Hide your face from my sins,
        and blot out all my iniquities.<br><br>
        10. Create in me a clean heart, O God,
        and renew a right spirit within me.<br><br>
        11. Cast me not away from your presence,
        and take not your Holy Spirit from me.<br><br>
        12. Restore to me the joy of your salvation,
        and uphold me with a willing spirit.<br><br>
        
        13. Then I will teach transgressors your ways,
        and sinners will return to you.<br><br>
        14. Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,
        O God of my salvation,
        and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.<br><br>
        15. O Lord, open my lips,
        and my mouth will declare your praise.<br><br>
        16. For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it;
        you will not be pleased with a burnt offering.<br><br>
        17. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;
        a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.<br><br>
        
        18. Do good to Zion in your good pleasure;
        build up the walls of Jerusalem;<br><br>
        19. then will you delight in right sacrifices,
        in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings;
        then bulls will be offered on your altar.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 51 is a penitential psalm attributed to King David, expressing deep remorse and a plea for forgiveness after his sin with Bathsheba and the subsequent murder of her husband, Uriah. The psalm reflects David's repentant heart and his desire for restoration and renewal.</h4>
            David begins by appealing to God's mercy and steadfast love, acknowledging his transgressions and pleading for God to blot out his sins and cleanse him thoroughly. He recognizes the gravity of his actions, acknowledging that his sin is ever before him and that he has sinned against God alone. David acknowledges his sinful nature from birth and expresses a longing for God's wisdom and truth to dwell within him.<br><br>

            David implores God to purify him, using the imagery of hyssop, so that he may be cleansed and made whiter than snow. He longs to hear joy and gladness, asking God to restore the brokenness within him and to grant him a clean heart and a right spirit. He pleads for God's presence to remain with him and for the restoration of the joy of salvation.<br><br>
            
            In response to God's forgiveness and restoration, David promises to teach others God's ways and lead sinners back to Him. He seeks deliverance from the guilt of bloodshed and vows to sing aloud of God's righteousness. David asks for his lips to be opened to declare God's praise.<br><br>
            
            David acknowledges that external sacrifices alone are not enough to please God. Instead, he emphasizes the importance of a broken and contrite heart as the true sacrifice that God desires. He declares that God will not despise a broken spirit.<br><br>
            
            In the final verses, David prays for God's favor upon Zion and Jerusalem, asking for the city to be rebuilt and for God's pleasure to be found in the right sacrifices. He anticipates the offering of bulls on God's altar, signifying a restored relationship and the offering of true worship.<br><br></p>
