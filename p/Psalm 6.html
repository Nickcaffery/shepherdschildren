every night I flood my bed with tears;
I drench my couch with my weeping.<br><br>

it grows weak because of all my foes.<br><br>

8. Depart from me, all you workers of evil,
for the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping.<br><br>
9. The Lord has heard my plea;
the Lord accepts my prayer.<br><br>
10. All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled;
they shall turn back and be put to shame in a moment.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 6 is a prayer of distress attributed to King David. It conveys David's plea for mercy, healing, and deliverance while expressing his trust in God's faithfulness.</h4>
          In the beginning, David implores God not to rebuke or discipline him in anger or wrath. He acknowledges his anguish and physical affliction, seeking God's grace and healing for his troubled soul and troubled bones. David expresses his longing for relief and his question of how long he must endure his suffering.<br><br>

          David calls upon God to turn and deliver his life, emphasizing the request based on God's steadfast love. He acknowledges that once a person dies, they no longer have the opportunity to remember or praise God. Therefore, David appeals to God for deliverance while he is still alive.<br><br>
          
          David describes his emotional and physical exhaustion. He expresses his deep sorrow, weeping, and grieving, which have taken a toll on his strength and eyesight. David pleads with God to distance himself from his enemies, as he believes God has heard his weeping.<br><br>
          
          In verses 9 and 10, David asserts his trust in God's response to his plea. He declares that the Lord has heard his cry and accepted his prayer. David anticipates the shame and trouble that will come upon his enemies, with the confidence that they will be put to shame by God's intervention.<br><br></p>    
        <p><h4>Psalm 6 portrays the deep anguish and distress experienced by David, seeking God's mercy and deliverance. It reflects a plea for healing, relief from suffering, and the defeat of enemies. Ultimately, it underscores David's trust in God's faithfulness and his belief that God will hear and respond to his cries.</h4></p>
