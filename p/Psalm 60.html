        1. O God, you have rejected us, broken our defenses;

        2. You have made the land to quake; you have torn it open;
        repair its breaches, for it totters.<br><br>
        3. You have made your people see hard things;
        you have given us wine to drink that made us stagger.<br><br>
        
        4. You have set up a banner for those who fear you,

        "With exultation I will divide up Shechem

        You do not go out, O God, with our armies.<br><br>
        11. Oh, grant us help against the foe,
        for vain is the salvation of man!<br><br>
        12. With God we shall do valiantly;

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 60 is attributed to David and reflects a time of distress and defeat for Israel. It portrays a plea for restoration, divine intervention, and victory over enemies.</h4>
            David begins by acknowledging that God has rejected them and broken down their defenses. He appeals to God to restore them and repair the land, which is tottering due to the upheaval caused by God.<br><br>

            David acknowledges that God has allowed the people to experience hard things and be staggered like those who have drunk wine. The nation is in a state of turmoil and confusion.<br><br>
            
            In verse 4, David speaks of God setting up a banner for those who fear Him. This banner serves as a rallying point for God's beloved ones to seek deliverance and salvation. David implores God to answer and extend His right hand to save His people.<br><br>
            
            David declares that God has spoken in His holiness, proclaiming the division and possession of various regions. Shechem, the Valley of Succoth, Gilead, Manasseh, Ephraim, Judah, Moab, Edom, and Philistia are mentioned. These references symbolize God's authority and control over the territories.<br><br>
            
            David then expresses his desire to reach the fortified city and Edom, seeking victory over their enemies. He questions whether God has rejected them and if He no longer goes out with their armies. David appeals for God's help against their foes, acknowledging the futility of relying on human salvation.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a declaration of faith in God's power. David affirms that with God, they will do valiantly and it is He who will trample down their enemies.<br><br></p>
