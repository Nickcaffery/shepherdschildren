        1. Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion,
        which cannot be moved but abides forever.<br><br>
        2. As the mountains surround Jerusalem,
        so the Lord surrounds his people,
        from this time forth and forevermore.<br><br>
        3. For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest
        on the land allotted to the righteous,
        lest the righteous stretch out
        their hands to do wrong.<br><br>
        4. Do good, O Lord, to those who are good,
        and to those who are upright in their hearts!<br><br>
        5. But those who turn aside to their crooked ways,
        the Lord will lead away with evildoers!
        Peace be upon Israel!<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 125 emphasizes the security and protection of those who trust in the Lord. The psalmist uses imagery to depict the unshakable nature of Mount Zion and likens it to the steadfastness of those who place their trust in the Lord. Just as the mountains surround Jerusalem, the Lord surrounds and protects His people both now and forever.</h4>
            The psalmist assures that the scepter of wickedness will not have a lasting hold over the land allotted to the righteous. This signifies that the righteous will not be subjected to the oppressive rule of the wicked. The psalmist prays that the Lord would do good to those who are good and upright in heart, indicating a desire for God's favor and blessings upon the righteous.<br><br>

            In contrast, those who turn aside to crooked ways and align themselves with evildoers will be led away by the Lord. The psalmist acknowledges that the Lord will judge and separate the wicked from the righteous. The psalm concludes with a blessing of peace upon Israel, signifying the desire for well-being and harmony for God's chosen people.<br><br></p>
