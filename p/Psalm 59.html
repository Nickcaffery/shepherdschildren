        1. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God;
        protect me from those who rise up against me;<br><br>
        2. deliver me from those who work evil,
        and save me from bloodthirsty men.<br><br>
        
        3. For behold, they lie in wait for my life;
        fierce men stir up strife against me.
        For no transgression or sin of mine, O Lord,<br><br>
        4. for no fault of mine, they run and make ready.
        Awake, come to meet me, and see!<br><br>
        5. You, Lord God of hosts, are God of Israel.
        Rouse yourself to punish all the nations;
        spare none of those who treacherously plot evil. Selah<br><br>
        
        6. Each evening they come back,
        howling like dogs
        and prowling about the city.<br><br>
        7. There they are, bellowing with their mouths
        with swords in their lipsâ€”
        for "Who," they think, "will hear us?"<br><br>
        
        8. But you, O Lord, laugh at them;
        you hold all the nations in derision.<br><br>
        9. O my strength, I will watch for you,
        for you, O God, are my fortress.<br><br>
        10. My God in his steadfast love will meet me;
        God will let me look in triumph on my enemies.<br><br>
        
        11. Kill them not, lest my people forget;
        make them totter by your power and bring them down,
        O Lord, our shield!<br><br>
        12. For the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips,
        let them be trapped in their pride.
        For the cursing and lies that they utter,<br><br>
        13. consume them in wrath;
        consume them till they are no more,
        that they may know that God rules over Jacob
        to the ends of the earth. Selah<br><br>
        
        14. Each evening they come back,
        howling like dogs
        and prowling about the city.<br><br>
        15. They wander about for food
        and growl if they do not get their fill.<br><br>
        
        16. But I will sing of your strength;
        I will sing aloud of your steadfast love in the morning.
        For you have been to me a fortress
        and a refuge in the day of my distress.<br><br>
        17. O my Strength, I will sing praises to you,
        for you, O God, are my fortress,
        the God who shows me steadfast love.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 59 is a prayer of David in a time when Saul sent men to watch David's house and kill him. It depicts David's plea for deliverance from his enemies and his confidence in God's protection and steadfast love.</h4>
            David begins by calling upon God to deliver him from his enemies and protect him from those who rise up against him, including bloodthirsty and evil men. He acknowledges that they lie in wait for his life and stir up strife against him, despite his lack of transgression or fault.<br><br>

            David implores God to awake and come to meet him, appealing to God's identity as the Lord God of hosts and the God of Israel. He asks God to punish all the nations that plot evil and not spare those who treacherously scheme against him.<br><br>
            
            David describes how his enemies return each evening, howling like dogs and prowling the city. They bellow with swords in their lips, assuming that no one will hear them.<br><br>
            
            However, David declares that the Lord laughs at his enemies and holds all the nations in derision. He affirms his trust in God's strength and watches for Him as his fortress. He believes that God, in His steadfast love, will meet him and allow him to look in triumph upon his enemies.<br><br>
            
            David asks God not to kill his enemies outright, but rather to make them totter and bring them down by His power. He prays for their trapping in their pride, cursing, and lies. David desires that they be consumed in God's wrath until they are no more, recognizing that it is through their punishment that they will come to know that God rules over Jacob (Israel) and the entire earth.<br><br>
            
            David reiterates how his enemies come back each evening, howling like dogs and prowling the city, wandering about for food and growling if they do not satisfy their desires.<br><br>
            
            Nevertheless, David declares his intention to sing of God's strength and steadfast love in the morning. He praises God for being his fortress and refuge in times of distress. David affirms that he will sing praises to God, recognizing Him as his strength and the One who shows him steadfast love.<br><br></p>    
        <p><h4>Psalm 59 showcases David's plea for deliverance from his enemies and his trust in God's protection. It demonstrates David's unwavering confidence in God's strength and steadfast love, even in the face of opposition and danger. The psalm encourages believers to seek refuge in God and find solace in His unwavering love and protection.</h4></p>
