    <p class="sttext">
        1. I cry aloud to God,
        aloud to God, and he will hear me.<br><br>
        2. In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord;
        in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying;
        my soul refuses to be comforted.<br><br>
        3. When I remember God, I moan;
        when I meditate, my spirit faints. Selah<br><br>
        
        4. You hold my eyelids open;
        I am so troubled that I cannot speak.<br><br>
        5. I consider the days of old,
        the years long ago.<br><br>
        6. I said, "Let me remember my song in the night;
        let me meditate in my heart."
        Then my spirit made a diligent search:<br><br>
        7. "Will the Lord spurn forever,
        and never again be favorable?<br><br>
        8. Has his steadfast love forever ceased?
        Are his promises at an end for all time?<br><br>
        9. Has God forgotten to be gracious?
        Has he in anger shut up his compassion?" Selah<br><br>
        
        10. Then I said, "I will appeal to this,
        to the years of the right hand of the Most High."<br><br>
        11. I will remember the deeds of the Lord;
        yes, I will remember your wonders of old.<br><br>
        12. I will ponder all your work,
        and meditate on your mighty deeds.<br><br>
        13. Your way, O God, is holy.
        What god is great like our God?<br><br>
        14. You are the God who works wonders;
        you have made known your might among the peoples.<br><br>
        15. You with your arm redeemed your people,
        the children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah<br><br>
        
        16. When the waters saw you, O God,
        when the waters saw you, they were afraid;
        indeed, the deep trembled.<br><br>
        17. The clouds poured out water;
        the skies gave forth thunder;
        your arrows flashed on every side.<br><br>
        18. The crash of your thunder was in the whirlwind;
        your lightnings lighted up the world;
        the earth trembled and shook.<br><br>
        19. Your way was through the sea,
        your path through the great waters;
        yet your footprints were unseen.<br><br>
        20. You led your people like a flock
        by the hand of Moses and Aaron.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 77 is a prayerful lament expressing deep anguish and seeking solace in God's past faithfulness. The psalmist cries out to God, seeking His presence and intervention in a time of trouble. They experience soul-wrenching sorrow and struggle to find comfort.</h4>
            The psalmist remembers God and meditates on Him, but their spirit is faint and troubled. They feel unable to speak and moan in distress. The psalmist questions if God will spurn them forever and wonders if His steadfast love and promises have ceased. They contemplate if God has forgotten to be gracious and if His compassion is locked away in anger.<br><br>

            However, the psalmist shifts their focus and chooses to appeal to the years of the right hand of the Most High. They purposefully remember the deeds of the Lord and His wonders of old. They resolve to ponder and meditate on God's work and mighty deeds. They affirm that God's ways are holy and acknowledge His uniqueness and greatness among all gods. They acknowledge God as the one who works wonders and reveals His might among the peoples. They specifically mention how God redeemed His people, the children of Jacob and Joseph, with His mighty arm.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist recalls the awe-inspiring manifestation of God's power in the presence of water. They describe how the waters and the deep trembled at the sight of God. They mention how clouds poured out water, thunder echoed, and God's arrows flashed. They depict the crash of thunder in the whirlwind, with lightning illuminating the world. The earth trembled and shook at God's presence. They recount God's leading of His people through the sea, guided by Moses and Aaron.<br><br></p>
