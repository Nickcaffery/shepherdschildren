        <p><h4>Psalm 114 recounts the deliverance of Israel from Egypt and the mighty acts of God on their behalf. It depicts the awe-inspiring power of God in controlling nature and bringing about miraculous events.</h4>
            The psalm begins by describing Israel's exodus from Egypt, the house of Jacob leaving a people with a strange language. It acknowledges that Judah became the sanctuary of God and Israel His dominion, signifying the special relationship between God and His chosen people.<br><br>

            The psalmist then portrays the extraordinary events that occurred during the exodus. The sea is personified as looking and fleeing, while the Jordan River is described as turning back. The mountains are depicted as skipping like rams, and the hills as leaping like lambs. These poetic descriptions symbolize the dramatic and supernatural elements surrounding Israel's liberation.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist questions the sea, Jordan, mountains, and hills regarding their response to God's presence. They marvel at the extraordinary phenomena that took place during the exodus and ask why these natural elements reacted in such a way.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a call for the earth to tremble at the presence of the Lord, the God of Jacob. It emphasizes God's power to transform and provide. The psalmist depicts God as turning rocks into pools of water and flints into springs, highlighting His ability to provide sustenance and refreshment even in arid and difficult circumstances.<br><br></p>
