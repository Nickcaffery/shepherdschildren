        1. Give ear, O my people, to my teaching;
        incline your ears to the words of my mouth!<br><br>
        2. I will open my mouth in a parable;
        I will utter dark sayings from of old,<br><br>
        3. things that we have heard and known,
        that our fathers have told us.<br><br>
        4. We will not hide them from their children,
        but tell to the coming generation
        the glorious deeds of the Lord, and his might,
        and the wonders that he has done.<br><br>
        
        5. He established a testimony in Jacob
        and appointed a law in Israel,
        which he commanded our fathers
        to teach to their children,<br><br>
        6. that the next generation might know them,
        the children yet unborn,
        and arise and tell them to their children,<br><br>
        7. so that they should set their hope in God
        and not forget the works of God,
        but keep his commandments;<br><br>
        8. and that they should not be like their fathers,
        a stubborn and rebellious generation,
        a generation whose heart was not steadfast,
        whose spirit was not faithful to God.<br><br>
        
        9. The Ephraimites, armed with the bow,
        turned back on the day of battle.<br><br>
        10. They did not keep God's covenant,
        but refused to walk according to his law.<br><br>
        11. They forgot his works
        and the wonders that he had shown them.<br><br>
        12. In the sight of their fathers he performed wonders
        in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.<br><br>
        13. He divided the sea and let them pass through it,
        and made the waters stand like a heap.<br><br>
        14. In the daytime he led them with a cloud,
        and all the night with a fiery light.<br><br>
        15. He split rocks in the wilderness
        and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep.<br><br>
        16. He made streams come out of the rock
        and caused waters to flow down like rivers.<br><br>
        
        17. Yet they sinned still more against him,
        rebelling against the Most High in the desert.<br><br>
        18. They tested God in their heart
        by demanding the food they craved.<br><br>
        19. They spoke against God, saying,
        "Can God spread a table in the wilderness?<br><br>
        20. He struck the rock so that water gushed out
        and streams overflowed.
        Can he also give bread
        or provide meat for his people?"<br><br>
        
        21. Therefore, when the Lord heard, he was full of wrath;
        a fire was kindled against Jacob;
        his anger rose against Israel,<br><br>
        22. because they did not believe in God
        and did not trust his saving power.<br><br>
        23. Yet he commanded the skies above
        and opened the doors of heaven,<br><br>
        24. and he rained down on them manna to eat
        and gave them the grain of heaven.<br><br>
        25. Man ate of the bread of the angels;
        he sent them food in abundance.<br><br>
        26. He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens,
        and by his power he led out the south wind;<br><br>
        27. he rained meat on them like dust,
        winged birds like the sand of the seas;<br><br>
        28. he let them fall in the midst of their camp,
        all around their dwellings.<br><br>
        29. And they ate and were well filled,
        for he gave them what they craved.<br><br>
        
        30. But before they had satisfied their craving,
        while the food was still in their mouths,<br><br>
        31. the anger of God rose against them,
        and he killed the strongest of them
        and laid low the young men of Israel.<br><br>
        
        32. In spite of all this, they still sinned;
        despite his wonders, they did not believe.<br><br>
        33. So he made their days vanish like a breath,
        and their years in terror.<br><br>
        34. When he killed them, they sought him;
        they repented and sought God earnestly.<br><br>
        35. They remembered that God was their rock,
        the Most High God their redeemer.<br><br>
        36. But they flattered him with their mouths;
        they lied to him with their tongues.<br><br>
        37. Their heart was not steadfast toward him;
        they were not faithful to his covenant.<br><br>
        38. Yet he, being compassionate,
        atoned for their iniquity
        and did not destroy them;
        he restrained his anger often
        and did not stir up all his wrath.<br><br>
        39. He remembered that they were but flesh,
        a wind that passes and comes not again.<br><br>
        
        40. How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness
        and grieved him in the desert!<br><br>
        41. They tested God again and again
        and provoked the Holy One of Israel.<br><br>
        42. They did not remember his power
        or the day when he redeemed them from the foe,<br><br>
        43. when he performed his signs in Egypt
        and his marvels in the fields of Zoan.<br><br>
        44. He turned their rivers to blood,
        so that they could not drink of their streams.<br><br>
        45. He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them,
        and frogs, which destroyed them.<br><br>
        46. He gave their crops to the destroying locust
        and the fruit of their labor to the locust.<br><br>
        47. He destroyed their vines with hail
        and their sycamores with frost.<br><br>
        48. He gave over their cattle to the hail
        and their flocks to thunderbolts.<br><br>
        49. He let loose on them his burning anger,
        wrath, indignation, and distress,
        a company of destroying angels.<br><br>
        50. He made a path for his anger;
        he did not spare them from death,
        but gave their lives over to the plague.<br><br>
        51. He struck down every firstborn in Egypt,
        the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.<br><br>
        52. Then he led out his people like sheep
        and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br><br>
        53. He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid,
        but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br><br>
        54. And he brought them to his holy land,
        to the mountain which his right hand had won.<br><br>
        55. He drove out nations before them;
        he apportioned them for a possession
        and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.<br><br>
        
        56. Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God
        and did not keep his testimonies,<br><br>
        57. but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers58 they twisted like a deceitful bow.
        For they provoked him to anger with their high places;
        they moved him to jealousy with their idols.<br><br>
        59. When God heard, he was full of wrath,
        and he utterly rejected Israel.<br><br>
        60. He abandoned his dwelling at Shiloh,
        the tent where he dwelt among mankind,<br><br>
        61. and delivered his power to captivity,
        his glory to the hand of the foe.<br><br>
        62. He gave his people over to the sword
        and vented his wrath on his heritage.<br><br>
        63. Fire devoured their young men,
        and their young women had no marriage song.<br><br>
        64. Their priests fell by the sword,
        and their widows made no lamentation.<br><br>
        65. Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,
        like a strong man shouting because of wine.<br><br>
        66. And he put his adversaries to rout;
        he put them to everlasting shame.<br><br>
        
        67. He rejected the tent of Joseph;
        he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,<br><br>
        68. but he chose the tribe of Judah,
        Mount Zion, which he loves.<br><br>
        69. He built his sanctuary like the high heavens,
        like the earth, which he has founded forever.<br><br>
        70. He chose David his servant
        and took him from the sheepfolds;<br><br>
        71. from following the nursing ewes he brought him
        to shepherd Jacob his people,
        Israel his inheritance.<br><br>
        72. With upright heart he shepherded them
        and guided them with his skillful hand.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 78 is a lengthy psalm that recounts the history of Israel, emphasizing God's faithfulness and the people's rebellion. The psalmist calls on the people to listen and remember the teachings and deeds of God. They highlight the importance of passing on this knowledge to future generations.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by exhorting the people to give ear and listen to their teaching. They indicate that they will speak in parables and utter dark sayings from old. They emphasize the importance of not hiding these teachings from children but sharing the glorious deeds, might, and wonders of the Lord.<br><br>

            The psalmist recalls how God established a testimony and law in Jacob and Israel, instructing their fathers to pass them down to future generations. The purpose of this transmission is to inspire hope in God, to remember His works, and to keep His commandments. They urge the people to avoid the stubbornness and rebellion of their ancestors, whose hearts were not steadfast and whose spirits were unfaithful to God.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist gives examples of the people's rebellion in the past. They mention the Ephraimites turning back in battle and failing to keep God's covenant. They recount how the people forgot God's works and wonders in Egypt, where He performed signs and marvels. The psalmist describes God's provision of manna, water from the rock, and guidance with a cloud and fire. Despite these displays of God's power, the people continued to sin and doubt Him, demanding food and questioning His ability to provide in the wilderness.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist recounts how God's anger was kindled against the people for their unbelief and lack of trust. They describe God's response by raining down manna, giving them the bread of angels, and providing meat like dust. However, the people's insatiable craving and ungratefulness led to further consequences. God struck down the strongest and youngest among them.<br><br>
            
            Despite God's wonders, the people continued to sin and rebel. The psalmist describes how God made their days vanish like a breath and their years in terror. In times of distress, the people sought God and repented, but their hearts were not steadfast, and they did not remain faithful to the covenant. Nevertheless, God, in His compassion, atoned for their iniquity and did not fully destroy them. He remembered their human nature and restrained His anger.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist highlights various instances of the people's rebellion, testing, and provocation of God, such as their doubt in the wilderness, their forgetfulness of God's power, and their idolatry. They describe how God responded by rejecting Israel, abandoning His dwelling, and giving power and glory to their enemies.<br><br>
            
            However, the psalmist emphasizes God's choice of Judah and Mount Zion. He built His sanctuary there, comparable to the high heavens and the earth. He chose David as His servant and shepherd for His people, guiding them with an upright heart and skillful hand.<br><br></p>    
        <p><h4>Psalm 78 serves as a reminder of Israel's history, highlighting both God's faithfulness and the people's rebelliousness. It underscores the importance of passing on the knowledge of God's works and commandments to future generations. The psalmist emphasizes God's choice of Judah and David as instruments of His purpose, despite the people's shortcomings.</h4></p>
