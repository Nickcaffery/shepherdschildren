        I do not occupy myself with things
        too great and too marvelous for me.<br><br>

        <p><h4>Psalm 131 is a short psalm that conveys a message of humility, contentment, and trust in the Lord. The psalmist expresses a humble posture and a tranquil soul, likening themselves to a weaned child resting in the presence of its mother.</h4>
            The psalmist declares that their heart is not lifted up with pride, nor are their eyes raised too high in arrogance. They do not concern themselves with matters beyond their understanding or capacity. The psalmist acknowledges the limitations of their own understanding and wisdom, choosing instead to maintain a humble and modest perspective.<br><br>

            The psalmist uses the metaphor of a weaned child with its mother to describe their state of contentment and inner peace. Just as a weaned child has been satisfied and no longer seeks nourishment from its mother's breast, the psalmist has found satisfaction and tranquility within their relationship with the Lord. They have calmed and quieted their soul, finding rest and security in the presence of God.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a call to Israel to put their hope in the Lord. It serves as an invitation to the community to embrace the same humility, contentment, and trust that the psalmist has found. The psalmist encourages Israel to place their hope in the Lord, both in the present and for all time to come.<br><br></p>
