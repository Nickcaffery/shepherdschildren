        <p><h4>Psalm 110 is a Messianic psalm that speaks of the exalted status and authority of the Lord's anointed, who is addressed as "my Lord" by the psalmist. This psalm is often understood as pointing to the Messiah, Jesus Christ.</h4>
            The psalm begins with a divine declaration, where the Lord speaks to the psalmist's Lord, inviting him to sit at His right hand. This position signifies a place of honor, authority, and power. The psalmist envisions the exaltation and enthronement of the Lord's anointed, who will be victorious over his enemies.<br><br>

            The Lord sends forth his mighty scepter from Zion, symbolizing the authority and dominion of the anointed one. The psalmist acknowledges that the Lord's anointed will rule in the midst of his enemies, demonstrating his power and sovereignty.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist describes the voluntary devotion of the people to the Lord's anointed on the day of his power. They offer themselves freely and wear holy garments, signifying their dedication and readiness to serve him. The imagery of the dew of youth from the womb of the morning represents the vitality and strength of the Lord's anointed.<br><br>
            
            The psalm highlights the eternal priesthood of the Lord's anointed, stating that he is a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. This reference connects the Lord's anointed with the mysterious figure of Melchizedek, who was both a king and a priest.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist declares that the Lord is at the right hand of the Lord's anointed, emphasizing God's support, protection, and involvement in his victorious reign. The Lord will bring judgment upon the nations, shattering kings and chiefs, filling the earth with corpses. The psalmist envisions the Lord's anointed executing divine justice and displaying his power over the nations.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a vivid image of the Lord's anointed drinking from the brook by the way and then lifting up his head in triumph. This image symbolizes his satisfaction and victory over his enemies.<br><br></p>
