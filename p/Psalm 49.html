        1. Hear this, all peoples!
        Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,<br><br>
        2. both low and high,
        rich and poor together!<br><br>
        3. My mouth shall speak wisdom;
        the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.<br><br>
        4. I will incline my ear to a proverb;
        I will solve my riddle to the music of the lyre.<br><br>
        
        5. Why should I fear in times of trouble,
        when the iniquity of those who cheat me surrounds me,<br><br>
        6. those who trust in their wealth
        and boast of the abundance of their riches?<br><br>
        7. Truly no man can ransom another,
        or give to God the price of his life,<br><br>
        8. for the ransom of their life is costly
        and can never suffice,<br><br>
        9. that he should live on forever
        and never see the pit.<br><br>
        
        10. For he sees that even the wise die;
        the fool and the stupid alike must perish
        and leave their wealth to others.<br><br>
        11. Their graves are their homes forever,
        their dwelling places to all generations,
        though they called lands by their own names.<br><br>
        12. Man in his pomp will not remain;
        he is like the beasts that perish.<br><br>
        
        13. This is the path of those who have foolish confidence;
        yet after them people approve of their boasts. Selah<br><br>
        14. Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol;
        death shall be their shepherd,
        and the upright shall rule over them in the morning.
        Their form shall be consumed in Sheol, with no place to dwell.<br><br>
        15. But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol,
        for he will receive me. Selah<br><br>
        
        16. Be not afraid when a man becomes rich,
        when the glory of his house increases.<br><br>
        17. For when he dies he will carry nothing away;
        his glory will not go down after him.<br><br>
        18. For though, while he lives, he counts himself blessed
        and though you get praise when you do well for yourself,<br><br>
        19. his soul will go to the generation of his fathers,
        who will never again see light.<br><br>
        20. Man in his pomp yet without understanding is like the beasts that perish.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 49 addresses the universal theme of the fleeting nature of wealth and the certainty of death. The psalmist calls upon all people, regardless of their status or wealth, to listen and reflect on the wisdom being spoken.</h4>
            The psalmist acknowledges the presence of trouble and the surrounding iniquity of those who cheat them. They observe that people who trust in their wealth and boast about their riches are ultimately unable to ransom or redeem themselves before God. The psalmist recognizes that no amount of wealth can secure eternal life or prevent one from seeing the grave.<br><br>

            The psalmist contrasts the mortality of both the wise and the foolish, emphasizing that all people, regardless of their intelligence or wealth, will perish and leave their possessions behind. They describe the graves as the eternal homes of people, even those who claimed ownership over lands during their lives. The psalmist compares human pomp and pride to that of beasts, emphasizing the futility of earthly achievements.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist highlights the path of those who place foolish confidence in their wealth and boasts. They liken them to sheep appointed for Sheol (the realm of the dead), with death as their shepherd. In contrast, the upright will rule over them in the morning, indicating the righteous will ultimately prevail. The psalmist expresses confidence in God's ability to ransom their soul from the power of Sheol, offering hope for deliverance.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist advises against fear or envy when witnessing the increasing wealth and glory of others. They remind the listeners that upon death, people cannot take their wealth or glory with them. The psalmist asserts that those who are wealthy in life will eventually join their ancestors in darkness, never again seeing light. They reiterate the comparison of humans in their pomp without understanding to perishing beasts.<br><br></p>
