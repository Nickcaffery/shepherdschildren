        1. Praise the Lord!
        For it is good to sing praises to our God;
        for it is pleasant, and a song of praise is fitting.<br><br>
        2. The Lord builds up Jerusalem;
        he gathers the outcasts of Israel.<br><br>
        3. He heals the brokenhearted
        and binds up their wounds.<br><br>
        4. He determines the number of the stars;
        he gives to all of them their names.<br><br>
        5. Great is our Lord, and abundant in power;
        his understanding is beyond measure.<br><br>
        6. The Lord lifts up the humble;
        he casts the wicked to the ground.<br><br>
        
        7. Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving;
        make melody to our God on the lyre!<br><br>
        8. He covers the heavens with clouds;
        he prepares rain for the earth;
        he makes grass grow on the hills.<br><br>
        9. He gives to the beasts their food,
        and to the young ravens that cry.<br><br>
        10. His delight is not in the strength of the horse,
        nor his pleasure in the legs of a man,<br><br>
        11. but the Lord takes pleasure in those who fear him,
        in those who hope in his steadfast love.<br><br>
        
        12. Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem!
        Praise your God, O Zion!<br><br>
        13. For he strengthens the bars of your gates;
        he blesses your children within you.<br><br>
        14. He makes peace in your borders;
        he fills you with the finest of the wheat.<br><br>
        15. He sends out his command to the earth;
        his word runs swiftly.<br><br>
        16. He gives snow like wool;
        he scatters frost like ashes.<br><br>
        17. He hurls down his crystals of ice like crumbs;
        who can stand before his cold?<br><br>
        18. He sends out his word, and melts them;
        he makes his wind blow and the waters flow.<br><br>
        19. He declares his word to Jacob,
        his statutes and rules to Israel.<br><br>
        20. He has not dealt thus with any other nation;
        they do not know his rules.
        Praise the Lord!<br><br></p>
