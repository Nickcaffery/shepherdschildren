        1. Oh come, let us sing to the Lord;
        let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation!<br><br>
        2. Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving;
        let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise!<br><br>
        3. For the Lord is a great God,
        and a great King above all gods.<br><br>
        4. In his hand are the depths of the earth;
        the heights of the mountains are his also.<br><br>
        5. The sea is his, for he made it,
        and his hands formed the dry land.<br><br>
        
        6. Oh come, let us worship and bow down;
        let us kneel before the Lord, our Maker!<br><br>
        7. For he is our God,
        and we are the people of his pasture,
        and the sheep of his hand.
        
        Today, if you hear his voice,<br><br>
        8. do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah,
        as on the day at Massah in the wilderness,<br><br>
        9. when your fathers put me to the test
        and put me to the proof, though they had seen my work.<br><br>
        10. For forty years I loathed that generation
        and said, "They are a people who go astray in their heart,
        and they have not known my ways."<br><br>
        11. Therefore I swore in my wrath,
        "They shall not enter my rest."<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 95 is a psalm of praise and exhortation to worship the Lord with joyful noise and thanksgiving. It warns against hardening hearts and recalls the disobedience of the Israelites in the wilderness.</h4>
            The psalmist invites the people to come together and sing to the Lord, making a joyful noise to the rock of their salvation. They encourage entering God's presence with thanksgiving and praising Him with songs. The psalmist declares that the Lord is a great God and the King above all gods. They acknowledge that God's hands hold the depths of the earth, the heights of the mountains, and the sea, as He is the Creator of all things.<br><br>

            The psalmist calls for worship, bowing down, and kneeling before the Lord, recognizing Him as their Maker. They affirm that God is their God, and they are the people of His pasture, like sheep in His care.<br><br>
            
            The psalm takes a cautionary turn, reminding the people not to harden their hearts as their ancestors did at Meribah and Massah in the wilderness. The psalmist refers to the incident when the Israelites tested and doubted God, despite witnessing His miraculous works. The psalmist attributes God's displeasure to that generation's waywardness and lack of understanding of His ways. As a consequence, God swore in His wrath that they would not enter His rest.<br><br></p>    
        <p><h4>Psalm 95 encourages praise, thanksgiving, and joyful worship of the Lord as the great God and King. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and creative power. The psalm also serves as a warning against hardening hearts and rebelling against God, drawing on the example of the Israelites in the wilderness. It emphasizes the importance of knowing and following God's ways in order to enter His rest and receive His blessings.</h4></p>
