        1. Hear my prayer, O Lord;
        give ear to my pleas for mercy!
        In your faithfulness answer me, in your righteousness!<br><br>
        2. Enter not into judgment with your servant,
        for no one living is righteous before you.<br><br>
        
        3. For the enemy has pursued my soul;
        he has crushed my life to the ground;<br><br>
        4. Therefore my spirit faints within me;
        my heart within me is appalled.<br><br>
        
        5. I remember the days of old;
        I meditate on all that you have done;
        I ponder the work of your hands.<br><br>
        6. I stretch out my hands to you;
        my soul thirsts for you like a parched land.<br><br>
        
        7. Answer me quickly, O Lord!
        My spirit fails!
        Hide not your face from me,
        lest I be like those who go down to the pit.<br><br>
        8. Let me hear in the morning of your steadfast love,
        for in you I trust.
        Make me know the way I should go,
        for to you I lift up my soul.<br><br>
        
        9. Deliver me from my enemies, O Lord!
        I have fled to you for refuge.<br><br>
        10. Teach me to do your will,
        for you are my God!
        Let your good Spirit lead me
        on level ground!<br><br>
        
        11. For your name's sake, O Lord, preserve my life!
        In your righteousness bring my soul out of trouble!<br><br>
        12. And in your steadfast love you will cut off my enemies,
        and you will destroy all the adversaries of my soul,
        for I am your servant.<br><br></p>
