        1. How lovely is your dwelling place,
        O Lord of hosts!<br><br>
        2. My soul longs, yes, faints
        for the courts of the Lord;
        my heart and flesh sing for joy
        to the living God.<br><br>
        
        3. Even the sparrow finds a home,
        and the swallow a nest for herself,
        where she may lay her young,
        at your altars, O Lord of hosts,
        my King and my God.<br><br>
        4. Blessed are those who dwell in your house,
        ever singing your praise! Selah<br><br>
        
        5. Blessed are those whose strength is in you,
        in whose heart are the highways to Zion.<br><br>
        6. As they go through the Valley of Baca
        they make it a place of springs;
        the early rain also covers it with pools.<br><br>
        7. They go from strength to strength;
        each one appears before God in Zion.<br><br>
        
        8. O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer;
        give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah<br><br>
        9. Behold our shield, O God;
        look on the face of your anointed!<br><br>
        
        10. For a day in your courts is better
        than a thousand elsewhere.
        I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God
        than dwell in the tents of wickedness.<br><br>
        11. For the Lord God is a sun and shield;
        the Lord bestows favor and honor.
        No good thing does he withhold
        from those who walk uprightly.<br><br>
        12. O Lord of hosts,
        blessed is the one who trusts in you!<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 84 is a song of longing and praise for the presence of God. The psalmist expresses deep longing for the dwelling place of God and joyfully praises Him as the living God.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by declaring the loveliness of God's dwelling place, expressing a deep desire to be there. They yearn for the courts of the Lord, and their soul longs and faints for His presence. The psalmist's heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God.<br><br>

            The psalmist reflects on the privilege of finding a home and a place of rest in God's presence. They draw a parallel between even the sparrows and swallows who find a place to nest near God's altars, and the blessedness of those who dwell in God's house and continually sing His praise.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist acknowledges that the strength of the blessed ones comes from God. They describe their hearts as having highways that lead to Zion, the place of God's presence. Even as they journey through difficult valleys, they turn them into places of refreshment and blessing. They go from strength to strength, ultimately appearing before God in Zion.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist appeals to God, the Lord God of hosts, to hear their prayer. They recognize God as their shield and ask Him to look upon the face of His anointed one.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist declares the superiority of being in the courts of God compared to anywhere else. They express a willingness to be a humble doorkeeper in the house of God rather than dwell in the tents of wickedness. They emphasize that a single day in God's courts is better than a thousand elsewhere.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist describes God as a sun and shield, the provider of favor, honor, and every good thing to those who walk uprightly. They conclude by affirming the blessedness of those who trust in the Lord of hosts.<br><br></p>    
        <p><h4>Psalm 84 expresses a deep longing for God's presence and praises Him as the living God. The psalmist emphasizes the blessedness of dwelling in God's house and finding strength and refreshment in Him. They exalt the superiority of being in God's presence over anywhere else and affirm the goodness and provision of the Lord for those who trust in Him.</h4></p>
