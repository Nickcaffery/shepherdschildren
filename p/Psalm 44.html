        1. O God, we have heard with our ears,
        our fathers have told us,
        what deeds you performed in their days,
        in the days of old:<br><br>
        2. you with your own hand drove out the nations,
        but them you planted;
        you afflicted the peoples,
        but them you set free;<br><br>
        3. for not by their own sword did they win the land,
        nor did their own arm save them,
        but your right hand and your arm,
        and the light of your face,
        for you delighted in them.<br><br>
        
        4. You are my King, O God;
        ordain salvation for Jacob!<br><br>
        5. Through you we push down our foes;
        through your name we tread down those who rise up against us.<br><br>
        6. For not in my bow do I trust,
        nor can my sword save me.<br><br>
        7. But you have saved us from our foes
        and have put to shame those who hate us.<br><br>
        8. In God we have boasted continually,
        and we will give thanks to your name forever. Selah<br><br>
        
        9. But you have rejected us and disgraced us
        and have not gone out with our armies.<br><br>
        10. You have made us turn back from the foe,
        and those who hate us have gotten spoil.<br><br>
        11. You have made us like sheep for slaughter
        and have scattered us among the nations.<br><br>
        12. You have sold your people for a trifle,
        demanding no high price for them.<br><br>
        13. You have made us the taunt of our neighbors,
        the derision and scorn of those around us.<br><br>
        14. You have made us a byword among the nations,
        a laughingstock among the peoples.<br><br>
        15. All day long my disgrace is before me,
        and shame has covered my face<br><br>
        16. at the sound of the taunter and reviler,
        at the sight of the enemy and the avenger.<br><br>
        
        17. All this has come upon us,
        though we have not forgotten you,
        and we have not been false to your covenant.<br><br>
        18. Our heart has not turned back,
        nor have our steps departed from your way;<br><br>
        19. yet you have broken us in the place of jackals
        and covered us with the shadow of death.<br><br>
        
        20. If we had forgotten the name of our God
        or spread out our hands to a foreign god,<br><br>
        21. would not God discover this?
        For he knows the secrets of the heart.<br><br>
        22. Yet for your sake we are killed all the day long;
        we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.<br><br>
        
        23. Awake! Why are you sleeping, O Lord?
        Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever!<br><br>
        24. Why do you hide your face?
        Why do you forget our affliction and oppression?<br><br>
        25. For our soul is bowed down to the dust;
        our belly clings to the ground.<br><br>
        26. Rise up; come to our help!
        Redeem us for the sake of your steadfast love.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 44 is a communal lament that recounts the history of God's deliverance and expresses the current distress of the people of Israel. The psalmist recalls how they have heard of God's mighty deeds in the past, how He drove out nations and planted Israel in the land. The psalmist acknowledges that it was not by their own strength but by God's power and favor that they experienced victory.</h4>
            The psalmist declares God as their King and calls for His salvation to be ordained for Jacob (Israel). They acknowledge that it is through God's name and power that they are able to overcome their enemies. They boast in God and give thanks to His name continually.<br><br>

            However, the psalm takes a turn as the psalmist expresses the current state of distress and apparent abandonment by God. They describe how the people have been rejected, disgraced, and defeated by their enemies. They have become like sheep for slaughter and have been scattered among the nations. The psalmist laments the taunting, scorn, and derision they face from their neighbors. They feel like a byword and a laughingstock among the nations.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist insists that despite their distress, the people have not forgotten God or been unfaithful to His covenant. They have remained true to God, yet they experience suffering and shame. They question why God allows this to happen and implore Him to wake up, not reject them forever, and remember their affliction and oppression. They call for God to intervene and redeem them because of His steadfast love.<br><br></p>
