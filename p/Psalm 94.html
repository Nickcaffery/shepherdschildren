        1. O Lord, God of vengeance,
        O God of vengeance, shine forth!<br><br>
        2. Rise up, O judge of the earth;
        repay to the proud what they deserve!<br><br>
        3. O Lord, how long shall the wicked,
        how long shall the wicked exult?<br><br>
        
        4. They pour out their arrogant words;
        all the evildoers boast.<br><br>
        5. They crush your people, O Lord,
        and afflict your heritage.<br><br>
        6. They kill the widow and the sojourner,
        and murder the fatherless;<br><br>
        7. and they say, "The Lord does not see;
        the God of Jacob does not perceive."<br><br>
        
        8. Understand, O dullest of the people!
        Fools, when will you be wise?<br><br>
        9. He who planted the ear, does he not hear?
        He who formed the eye, does he not see?<br><br>
        10. He who disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke?
        He who teaches man knowledge—<br><br>
        11. the Lord—knows the thoughts of man,
        that they are but a breath.<br><br>
        
        12. Blessed is the man whom you discipline, O Lord,
        and whom you teach out of your law,<br><br>
        13. to give him rest from days of trouble,
        until a pit is dug for the wicked.<br><br>
        14. For the Lord will not forsake his people;
        he will not abandon his heritage;<br><br>
        15. for justice will return to the righteous,
        and all the upright in heart will follow it.<br><br>
        
        16. Who rises up for me against the wicked?
        Who stands up for me against evildoers?<br><br>
        17. If the Lord had not been my help,
        my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence.<br><br>
        18. When I thought, "My foot slips,"
        your steadfast love, O Lord, held me up.<br><br>
        19. When the cares of my heart are many,
        your consolations cheer my soul.<br><br>
        
        20. Can wicked rulers be allied with you,
        those who frame injustice by statute?<br><br>
        21. They band together against the life of the righteous
        and condemn the innocent to death.<br><br>
        22. But the Lord has become my stronghold,
        and my God the rock of my refuge.<br><br>
        23. He will bring back on them their iniquity
        and wipe them out for their wickedness;
        the Lord our God will wipe them out.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 94 is a psalm that cries out to God for justice and deliverance from the wicked. The psalmist laments the arrogance and oppression of the wicked and expresses confidence in God's righteous judgment.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by addressing the Lord as the God of vengeance and calls for His intervention. They implore God to rise up as the judge of the earth and repay the proud according to their deeds. The psalmist questions how long the wicked will exult and prevail.<br><br>

            The psalmist describes the behavior of the wicked, highlighting their arrogant words and boastful attitudes. They depict the wicked as oppressors who crush God's people and afflict His heritage. The wicked engage in acts of violence, such as killing widows, sojourners, and the fatherless. They arrogantly declare that God does not see their actions and perceive their deeds.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist addresses the foolishness of those who deny God's knowledge and understanding. They emphasize that God, as the Creator, hears, sees, disciplines, and teaches. The Lord knows the thoughts of mankind, recognizing their fleeting nature.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist acknowledges the blessedness of being disciplined and taught by the Lord through His law. They express the hope of finding rest from trouble and anticipate the eventual judgment of the wicked. The psalmist affirms that the Lord will not forsake His people or abandon His heritage. Justice will be restored to the righteous, and the upright in heart will follow it.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist expresses their personal need for God's help and protection. They question who will rise up against the wicked and stand up for the righteous. They acknowledge that without the Lord's help, their soul would dwell in silence. In times of distress and slipping, the psalmist finds strength in the steadfast love of the Lord. The consolations of God bring comfort to their soul in the midst of their cares.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist raises concerns about wicked rulers who frame injustice through statutes. They depict the wicked as banding together against the righteous and condemning the innocent to death. However, the psalmist finds refuge in the Lord, who becomes their stronghold and rock of refuge. They trust that God will bring judgment upon the wicked, wiping them out for their wickedness.<br><br></p>
