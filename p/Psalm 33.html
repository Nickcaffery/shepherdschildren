        1. Sing for joy in the Lord, O you righteous!
        Praise befits the upright.<br><br>
        2. Give thanks to the Lord with the lyre;
        make melody to him with the harp of ten strings!<br><br>
        3. Sing to him a new song;
        play skillfully on the strings, with loud shouts.<br><br>
        
        4. For the word of the Lord is upright,
        and all his work is done in faithfulness.<br><br>
        5. He loves righteousness and justice;
        the earth is full of the steadfast love of the Lord.<br><br>
        
        6. By the word of the Lord the heavens were made,
        and by the breath of his mouth all their host.<br><br>
        7. He gathers the waters of the sea as a heap;
        he puts the deeps in storehouses.<br><br>
        
        8. Let all the earth fear the Lord;
        let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him!<br><br>
        9. For he spoke, and it came to be;
        he commanded, and it stood firm.<br><br>
        
        10. The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing;
        he frustrates the plans of the peoples.<br><br>
        11. The counsel of the Lord stands forever,
        the plans of his heart to all generations.<br><br>
        12. Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord,
        the people whom he has chosen as his heritage!<br><br>
        
        13. The Lord looks down from heaven;
        he sees all the children of man;<br><br>
        14. from where he sits enthroned he looks out
        on all the inhabitants of the earth,<br><br>
        15. he who fashions the hearts of them all
        and observes all their deeds.<br><br>
        
        16. The king is not saved by his great army;
        a warrior is not delivered by his great strength.<br><br>
        17. The war horse is a false hope for salvation,
        and by its great might it cannot rescue.<br><br>
        
        18. Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear him,
        on those who hope in his steadfast love,<br><br>
        19. that he may deliver their soul from death
        and keep them alive in famine.<br><br>
        
        20. Our soul waits for the Lord;
        he is our help and our shield.<br><br>
        21. For our heart is glad in him,
        because we trust in his holy name.<br><br>
        22. Let your steadfast love, O Lord, be upon us,
        even as we hope in you.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 33 is a psalm of praise and worship, exalting the Lord's righteousness, faithfulness, and creative power. It calls upon the righteous to sing for joy and give thanks to the Lord with music and skillful playing.</h4>
            The psalmist declares that the word of the Lord is upright, and His work is done in faithfulness. The Lord loves righteousness and justice, and His steadfast love fills the earth.<br><br>

            The psalmist acknowledges that by the word of the Lord, the heavens and their host were made, and by His breath, the waters of the sea were gathered. The psalmist calls upon all the earth to fear the Lord and stand in awe of Him, for His spoken command brings things into existence and establishes their firmness.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist recognizes that the Lord frustrates the plans of nations and peoples, while His own counsel stands forever. The psalmist declares the blessedness of the nation whose God is the Lord, the people whom He has chosen as His heritage.<br><br>
            
            The Lord is portrayed as the One who sees and knows all the children of man, observing their deeds and fashioning their hearts. The psalmist emphasizes that the king is not saved by his army, nor is a warrior delivered by his strength or a war horse. Instead, the psalmist asserts that the Lord's eye is on those who fear Him and hope in His steadfast love, delivering their souls and preserving them in times of trouble.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist expresses the waiting of their soul for the Lord, recognizing Him as their help and shield. Their heart is glad in Him, and they trust in His holy name. The psalm concludes with a plea for the Lord's steadfast love to be upon them as they continue to place their hope in Him.<br><br></p>
