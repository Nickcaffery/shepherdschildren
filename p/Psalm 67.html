        <p><h4>Psalm 67 is a psalm of blessing and a call for all nations to praise God. It expresses the desire for God's graciousness and blessings upon His people, with the purpose of making His way known and His saving power acknowledged among all nations.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by petitioning God to be gracious to them, bless them, and cause His face to shine upon them. This is a request for God's favor and the manifestation of His presence. The word "Selah" is inserted, indicating a pause or reflection.<br><br>

            The psalmist prays for God's blessing with the purpose of making His way known on earth and His saving power known among all nations. The desire is for the knowledge of God's ways and His ability to save to spread to every corner of the earth.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist calls for the peoples, representing all nations, to praise God. This is an invitation for all people to acknowledge and worship Him.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist further emphasizes the call for praise, urging the nations to be glad and sing for joy. The reason for this rejoicing is stated: God judges the peoples with equity and guides the nations on the earth. The psalmist recognizes God's just rule and His guidance over all nations. The word "Selah" is repeated, emphasizing the importance of reflecting on these truths.<br><br>
            
            Once again, the psalmist calls for the peoples to praise God, echoing the invitation for all nations to acknowledge and worship Him.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist acknowledges that the earth has yielded its increase, indicating God's provision and blessings. They affirm that God, their God, will continue to bless them. The repetition reinforces the confidence in God's ongoing favor.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a declaration that God will bless His people, and a call for all the ends of the earth to fear Him. This fear is not meant as terror or anxiety but as reverent awe and respect for the greatness of God.<br><br></p>
