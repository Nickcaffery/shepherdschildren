        1. O Lord, you have searched me and known me!<br><br>
        2. You know when I sit down and when I rise up;
        you discern my thoughts from afar.<br><br>
        3. You search out my path and my lying down
        and are acquainted with all my ways.<br><br>
        4. Even before a word is on my tongue,
        behold, O Lord, you know it altogether.<br><br>
        5. You hem me in, behind and before,
        and lay your hand upon me.<br><br>
        6. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
        it is high; I cannot attain it.<br><br>
        
        7. Where shall I go from your Spirit?
        Or where shall I flee from your presence?<br><br>
        8. If I ascend to heaven, you are there!
        If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there!<br><br>
        9. If I take the wings of the morning
        and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,<br><br>
        10. even there your hand shall lead me,
        and your right hand shall hold me.<br><br>
        11. If I say, "Surely the darkness shall cover me,
        and the light about me be night,"<br><br>
        12. even the darkness is not dark to you;
        the night is bright as the day,
        for darkness is as light with you.<br><br>
        
        13. For you formed my inward parts;
        you knitted me together in my mother's womb.<br><br>
        14. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
        Wonderful are your works;
        my soul knows it very well.<br><br>
        15. My frame was not hidden from you,
        when I was being made in secret,
        intricately woven in the depths of the earth.<br><br>
        16. Your eyes saw my unformed substance;
        in your book were written, every one of them,
        the days that were formed for me,
        when as yet there was none of them.<br><br>
        
        17. How precious to me are your thoughts, O God!
        How vast is the sum of them!<br><br>
        18. If I would count them, they are more than the sand.
        I awake, and I am still with you.<br><br>
        
        19. Oh that you would slay the wicked, O God!
        O men of blood, depart from me!<br><br>
        20. They speak against you with malicious intent;
        your enemies take your name in vain!<br><br>
        21. Do I not hate those who hate you, O Lord?
        And do I not loathe those who rise up against you?<br><br>
        22. I hate them with complete hatred;
        I count them my enemies.<br><br>
        
        23. Search me, O God, and know my heart!
        Try me and know my thoughts!<br><br>
        24. And see if there be any grievous way in me,
        and lead me in the way everlasting!<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 139 is a deeply personal and introspective psalm. It explores the profound relationship between the psalmist and God, highlighting God's omniscience, omnipresence, and intimate knowledge of the psalmist's innermost being.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by acknowledging that the Lord has searched and known them completely. God is aware of every aspect of the psalmist's life, from their actions to their thoughts. The psalmist marvels at God's perfect knowledge of them, recognizing that even before they speak a word, God already knows it.<br><br>

            The psalmist reflects on God's constant presence, realizing that there is nowhere they can go to escape His Spirit or flee from His presence. Whether they ascend to heaven or descend to Sheol, God is there. Even if they were to travel to the farthest corners of the sea or hide in the darkness, God's hand would lead and hold them. The psalmist acknowledges that darkness is not a barrier to God's knowledge and presence, for darkness is as light to Him.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist then turns their attention to the amazing work of God in their creation. They praise God for fearfully and wonderfully forming them in their mother's womb. The psalmist recognizes God's intricate involvement in their formation and acknowledges the wonder of His works. They acknowledge that their days were written in God's book even before they came into existence.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist expresses their awe and gratitude for God's thoughts towards them, realizing that they are precious and numerous. They acknowledge that God's knowledge is beyond comprehension, with thoughts more numerous than the sand. The psalmist finds comfort and assurance in the fact that they are constantly with God.<br><br>
            
            The psalm takes a shift in tone as the psalmist expresses a desire for God to deal with the wicked and those who rise up against Him. They express their hatred for those who hate and speak against God, counting them as enemies. The psalmist aligns themselves with God's righteousness and seeks justice against those who oppose Him.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a prayer for God to search and know the psalmist's heart and thoughts. The psalmist invites God to examine them, to reveal any grievous way within them, and to lead them in the way everlasting.<br><br></p>
