        1. Deliver me, O Lord, from evil men;
        preserve me from violent men,<br><br>
        2. who plan evil things in their heart
        and stir up wars continually.<br><br>
        3. They make their tongue sharp as a serpent's,
        and under their lips is the venom of asps.<br><br>
        
        4. Guard me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked;
        preserve me from violent men,
        who have planned to trip up my feet.<br><br>
        5. The arrogant have hidden a trap for me,
        and with cords they have spread a net;
        beside the way they have set snares for me.<br><br>
        
        6. I say to the Lord, You are my God;
        give ear to the voice of my pleas for mercy, O Lord!<br><br>
        7. O Lord, my Lord, the strength of my salvation,
        you have covered my head in the day of battle.<br><br>
        8. Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked;
        do not further their evil plot, or they will be exalted!<br><br>
        
        9. As for the head of those who surround me,
        let the mischief of their lips overwhelm them!<br><br>
        10. Let burning coals fall upon them!
        Let them be cast into fire,
        into miry pits, no more to rise!<br><br>
        11. Let not the slanderer be established in the land;
        let evil hunt down the violent man speedily!<br><br>
        
        12. I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
        and will execute justice for the needy.<br><br>
        13. Surely the righteous shall give thanks to your name;
        the upright shall dwell in your presence.<br><br></p>
