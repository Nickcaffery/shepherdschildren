        1. Save me, O God!
        For the waters have come up to my neck.<br><br>
        2. I sink in deep mire,
        where there is no foothold;
        I have come into deep waters,
        and the flood sweeps over me.<br><br>
        3. I am weary with my crying out;
        my throat is parched.
        My eyes grow dim
        with waiting for my God.<br><br>
        
        4. More in number than the hairs of my head
        are those who hate me without cause;
        mighty are those who would destroy me,
        those who attack me with lies.
        What I did not steal
        must I now restore?<br><br>
        5. O God, you know my folly;
        the wrongs I have done are not hidden from you.<br><br>
        
        6. Let not those who hope in you be put to shame through me,
        O Lord God of hosts;
        let not those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me,
        O God of Israel.<br><br>
        7. For it is for your sake that I have borne reproach,
        that dishonor has covered my face.<br><br>
        8. I have become a stranger to my brothers,
        an alien to my mother's sons.<br><br>
        
        9. For zeal for your house has consumed me,
        and the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.<br><br>
        10. When I wept and humbled my soul with fasting,
        it became my reproach.<br><br>
        11. When I made sackcloth my clothing,
        I became a byword to them.<br><br>
        12. I am the talk of those who sit in the gate,
        and the drunkards make songs about me.<br><br>
        
        13. But as for me, my prayer is to you, O Lord.
        At an acceptable time, O God,
        in the abundance of your steadfast love answer me in your saving faithfulness.<br><br>
        14. Deliver me from sinking in the mire;
        let me be delivered from my enemies and from the deep waters.<br><br>
        15. Let not the flood sweep over me,
        or the deep swallow me up,
        or the pit close its mouth over me.<br><br>
        
        16. Answer me, O Lord, for your steadfast love is good;
        according to your abundant mercy, turn to me.<br><br>
        17. Hide not your face from your servant,
        for I am in distress; make haste to answer me.<br><br>
        18. Draw near to my soul, redeem me;
        ransom me because of my enemies!<br><br>
        
        19. You know my reproach,
        and my shame and my dishonor;
        my foes are all known to you.<br><br>
        20. Reproaches have broken my heart,
        so that I am in despair.
        I looked for pity, but there was none,
        and for comforters, but I found none.<br><br>
        21. They gave me poison for food,
        and for my thirst they gave me sour wine to drink.<br><br>
        
        22. Let their own table before them become a snare;
        and when they are at peace, let it become a trap.<br><br>
        23. Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see,
        and make their loins tremble continually.<br><br>
        24. Pour out your indignation upon them,
        and let your burning anger overtake them.<br><br>
        25. May their camp be a desolation;
        let no one dwell in their tents.<br><br>
        
        26. For they persecute him whom you have struck down,
        and they recount the pain of those you have wounded.<br><br>
        27. Add to them punishment upon punishment;
        may they have no acquittal from you.<br><br>
        28. Let them be blotted out of the book of the living;
        let them not be enrolled among the righteous.<br><br>
        
        29. But I am afflicted and in pain;
        let your salvation, O God, set me on high!<br><br>
        
        30. I will praise the name of God with a song;
        I will magnify him with thanksgiving.<br><br>
        31. This will please the Lord more than an ox
        or a bull with horns and hoofs.<br><br>
        32. When the humble see it they will be glad;
        you who seek God, let your hearts revive.<br><br>
        33. For the Lord hears the needy
        and does not despise his own people who are prisoners.<br><br>
        
        34. Let heaven and earth praise him,
        the seas and everything that moves in them.<br><br>
        35. For God will save Zion
        and build up the cities of Judah,
        and people shall dwell there and possess it;<br><br>
        36. the offspring of his servants shall inherit it,
        and those who love his name shall dwell in it.<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 69 is a psalm of lament and plea for deliverance. It expresses the psalmist's distress, persecution, and desire for God's salvation. The psalmist calls upon God to rescue them from their enemies and expresses their longing for vindication and restoration.</h4>
            The psalm begins with a plea for God's salvation, as the psalmist feels overwhelmed by deep waters and sinking in the mire. They are weary from crying out and waiting for God, their throat is parched, and their eyes grow dim.<br><br>

            The psalmist describes the numerous enemies who hate them without cause, seeking to destroy them with lies. They acknowledge their own folly and confess that God knows their wrongdoings.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist prays that their situation would not cause shame or dishonor to those who hope in God. They bear reproach and become a stranger to their own family because of their zeal for God's house and the reproach that falls upon them.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist turns to God in prayer, asking for an answer in the abundance of Hissteadfast love and saving faithfulness. They plead for deliverance from the mire, from their enemies, and from the threat of being overwhelmed by the flood or swallowed up by the deep waters.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist appeals to God based on His steadfast love, abundant mercy, and His ability to redeem and ransom them from their enemies. They express their distress and implore God to draw near and answer quickly.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist acknowledges that God knows their reproach, shame, and dishonor, and their foes are known to Him. They express despair and the lack of pity or comforters. They describe being given poison for food and sour wine for their thirst.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist invokes curses upon their enemies, calling for their own table to become a snare and a trap. They desire their eyes to be darkened, their loins to tremble continually, and God's indignation and burning anger to be poured out upon them. They pray for their camp to become desolate and for them to be blotted out of the book of the living.<br><br>
            
            In contrast to their affliction and pain, the psalmist declares their trust in God's salvation and promises to praise God with a song and thanksgiving. They believe that their praise and magnification of God will please Him more than sacrifices. They encourage the humble and those who seek God to find revival in their hearts. They affirm that the Lord hears the needy and does not despise His own people who are prisoners.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a call for heaven, earth, the seas, and everything in them to praise God. The psalmist proclaims God's saving of Zion and the building up of the cities of Judah. The offspring of God's servants shall inherit it, and those who love His name shall dwell in it.<br><br></p>
        <p><h4>Psalm 69 expresses deep anguish and the psalmist's cry for deliverance from persecution and enemies. It also contains imprecatory prayers against the adversaries. Despite the psalmist's distress, they express their trust in God's salvation and vow to praise Him. The psalm emphasizes the psalmist's longing for vindication, restoration, and the ultimate triumph of God's people.</h4></p>
