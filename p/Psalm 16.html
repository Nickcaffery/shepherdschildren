        1. Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge.<br><br>
        2. I say to the Lord, "You are my Lord;
        I have no good apart from you."<br><br>
        
        3. As for the saints in the land, they are the excellent ones,
        in whom is all my delight.<br><br>
        
        4. The sorrows of those who run after another god shall multiply;
        their drink offerings of blood I will not pour out
        or take their names on my lips.<br><br>
        
        5. The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup;
        you hold my lot.<br><br>
        6. The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places;
        indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.<br><br>
        
        7. I bless the Lord who gives me counsel;
        in the night also my heart instructs me.<br><br>
        8. I have set the Lord always before me;
        because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.<br><br>
        
        9. Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices;
        my flesh also dwells secure.<br><br>
        10. For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol,
        or let your holy one see corruption.<br><br>
        
        11. You make known to me the path of life;
        in your presence, there is fullness of joy;
        at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 16 is a psalm of trust and confidence in God's protection and provision. It expresses the psalmist's commitment to seek refuge in God and acknowledges the blessings and joy found in His presence.</h4>
            The psalmist expresses delight in the saints, the godly people in the land who serve as examples of righteousness and faithfulness.<br><br>

            In verse 4, the psalmist contrasts the sorrows of those who worship false gods with their own devotion to the Lord. They refuse to participate in the offerings of blood made to other gods or to speak their names.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist declares that the Lord is their chosen portion and cup, symbolizing their inheritance and sustenance. They recognize God's sovereignty over their life and express contentment with the pleasant places and beautiful inheritance assigned to them by God.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist blesses the Lord for giving counsel and instruction, even in the night. They declare their constant awareness of God's presence and the assurance that He is always by their side, providing stability and security.<br><br>
            
            As a result, the psalmist's heart is glad, and their whole being rejoices. They trust that God will not abandon their soul to Sheol (the realm of the dead) or let their body decay. There is a confident belief in God's power over life and death.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist acknowledges that God makes known to them the path of life, leading to fullness of joy in His presence. They affirm the eternal pleasures that await at God's right hand.<br><br></p>
