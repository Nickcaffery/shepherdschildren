        1. To you, O Lord, I call;
        my rock, be not deaf to me,
        lest, if you be silent to me,
        I become like those who go down to the pit.<br><br>
        2. Hear the voice of my pleas for mercy,
        when I cry to you for help,
        when I lift up my hands
        toward your most holy sanctuary.<br><br>
        
        3. Do not drag me off with the wicked,
        with the workers of evil,
        who speak peace with their neighbors
        while evil is in their hearts.<br><br>
        4. Give to them according to their work
        and according to the evil of their deeds;
        render them their due reward.<br><br>
        5. Because they do not regard the works of the Lord
        or the work of his hands,
        he will tear them down and build them up no more.<br><br>
        
        6. Blessed be the Lord!
        For he has heard the voice of my pleas for mercy.<br><br>
        7. The Lord is my strength and my shield;
        in him my heart trusts, and I am helped;
        my heart exults,
        and with my song I give thanks to him.<br><br>
        
        8. The Lord is the strength of his people;
        he is the saving refuge of his anointed.<br><br>
        9. Oh, save your people and bless your heritage!
        Be their shepherd and carry them forever.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 28 is a plea for God's mercy and deliverance from the psalmist's enemies. It expresses trust in God's strength and protection, acknowledging His role as the shepherd and savior of His people.</h4>
            The psalm begins with a cry to the Lord, addressing Him as their rock. The psalmist pleads for God's attention and asks Him not to be silent, fearing that without His response, they will become like those who go down to the pit. They lift their hands toward God's sanctuary, seeking His mercy and help.<br><br>

            In verses 3 and 4, the psalmist expresses a desire to be separated from the wicked and workers of evil. They describe these individuals as speaking peace with their neighbors while harboring evil intentions in their hearts. The psalmist prays that God would give them what they deserve according to their deeds.<br><br>
            
            Verse 5 highlights the wicked's disregard for the works of the Lord and the work of His hands. As a consequence, the psalmist believes that God will tear them down and no longer build them up.<br><br>
            
            In verses 6 and 7, the psalmist breaks into praise and thanksgiving. They bless the Lord for hearing their pleas for mercy and acknowledge Him as their strength, shield, and helper. The psalmist's heart exults, and they offer a song of thanks to God.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist declares that the Lord is the strength and saving refuge of His people, emphasizing God's role as the protector of His anointed ones. They conclude the psalm with a plea for God to save His people, bless them, be their shepherd, and carry them forever.<br><br></p>
