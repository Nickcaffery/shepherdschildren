        1. O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you;
        my soul thirsts for you;
        my flesh faints for you,
        as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.<br><br>
        2. So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary,
        beholding your power and glory.<br><br>
        3. Because your steadfast love is better than life,
        my lips will praise you.<br><br>

        in your name I will lift up my hands.<br><br>
        
        5. My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food,

        and meditate on you in the watches of the night;<br><br>
        7. for you have been my help,
        and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy.<br><br>
        8. My soul clings to you;
        your right hand upholds me.<br><br>
        
        9. But those who seek to destroy my life
        shall go down into the depths of the earth;<br><br>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 63, attributed to David, is a heartfelt expression of longing for God's presence and a declaration of trust in His steadfast love. It portrays David's deep spiritual thirst and reliance on God as his help and refuge.</h4>
            David begins by declaring his earnest pursuit of God, acknowledging Him as his personal God. He describes the intense longing of his soul for God, comparing it to the thirst and faintness experienced in a dry and weary land without water.<br><br>

            David recounts his experience of beholding God's power and glory in the sanctuary. He recognizes that God's steadfast love is superior to life itself, and as a result, his lips are filled with praise. David commits to blessing God and lifting up his hands in His name for as long as he lives.<br><br>
            
            David expresses his expectation that his soul will be satisfied as with rich and satisfying food, and his mouth will overflow with joyful praise. He recalls meditating on God during the night, upon his bed and in the watches of the night. He affirms that God has been his help and takes refuge in the shadow of His wings. In this secure and protected place, David finds reason to sing for joy.<br><br>
            
            David declares that his soul clings to God, signifying his deep attachment and reliance on Him. He acknowledges that God's right hand upholds and supports him.<br><br>
            
            In contrast, David acknowledges the fate of those who seek to destroy his life. They will go down into the depths of the earth, be given over to the power of the sword, and become a portion for jackals. However, the king (likely referring to himself or a righteous ruler) will rejoice in God. Those who swear allegiance to God will exult, while the mouths of liars will be stopped.<br><br></p>
