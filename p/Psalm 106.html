        1. Praise the Lord!
        Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good,
        for his steadfast love endures forever!<br><br>
        2. Who can utter the mighty deeds of the Lord,
        or declare all his praise?<br><br>
        3. Blessed are they who observe justice,
        who do righteousness at all times!<br><br>
        
        4. Remember me, O Lord, when you show favor to your people;
        help me when you save them,<br><br>
        5. that I may look upon the prosperity of your chosen ones,
        that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation,
        that I may glory with your inheritance.<br><br>
        
        6. Both we and our fathers have sinned;
        we have committed iniquity; we have done wickedness.<br><br>
        7. Our fathers, when they were in Egypt,
        did not consider your wondrous works;
        they did not remember the abundance of your steadfast love,
        but rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.<br><br>
        8. Yet he saved them for his name's sake,
        that he might make known his mighty power.<br><br>
        9. He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry,
        and he led them through the deep as through a desert.<br><br>
        10. So he saved them from the hand of the foe
        and redeemed them from the power of the enemy.<br><br>
        11. And the waters covered their adversaries;
        not one of them was left.<br><br>
        12. Then they believed his words;
        they sang his praise.<br><br>
        
        13. But they soon forgot his works;
        they did not wait for his counsel.<br><br>
        14. But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness,
        and put God to the test in the desert;<br><br>
        15. he gave them what they asked,
        but sent a wasting disease among them.<br><br>
        
        16. When men in the camp were jealous of Moses
        and Aaron, the holy one of the Lord,<br><br>
        17. the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
        and covered the company of Abiram.<br><br>
        18. Fire also broke out in their company;
        the flame burned up the wicked.<br><br>
        
        19. They made a calf in Horeb
        and worshiped a metal image.<br><br>
        20. They exchanged the glory of God
        for the image of an ox that eats grass.<br><br>
        21. They forgot God, their Savior,
        who had done great things in Egypt,<br><br>
        22. wondrous works in the land of Ham,
        and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.<br><br>
        23. Therefore he said he would destroy themâ€”
        had not Moses, his chosen one,
        stood in the breach before him,
        to turn away his wrath from destroying them.<br><br>
        
        24. Then they despised the pleasant land,
        having no faith in his promise.<br><br>
        25. They murmured in their tents,
        and did not obey the voice of the Lord.<br><br>
        26. Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them
        that he would make them fall in the wilderness,<br><br>
        27. and would make their offspring fall among the nations,
        scattering them among the lands.<br><br>
        
        28. Then they yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor,
        and ate sacrifices offered to the dead;<br><br>
        29. they provoked the Lord to anger with their deeds,
        and a plague broke out among them.<br><br>
        30. Then Phinehas stood up and intervened,
        and the plague was stayed.<br><br>
        31. And that was counted to him as righteousness
        from generation to generation forever.<br><br>
        
        32. They angered him at the waters of Meribah,
        and it went ill with Moses on their account,<br><br>
        33. for they made his spirit bitter,
        and he spoke rashly with his lips.<br><br>
        
        34. They did not destroy the peoples,
        as the Lord commanded them,<br><br>
        35. but they mixed with the nations
        and learned to do as they did.<br><br>
        36. They served their idols,
        which became a snare to them.<br><br>
        37. They sacrificed their sons
        and their daughters to the demons;<br><br>
        38. they poured out innocent blood,
        the blood of their sons and daughters,
        whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan,
        and the land was polluted with blood.<br><br>
        39. Thus they became unclean by their acts,
        and played the whore in their deeds.<br><br>
        
        40. Then the anger of the Lord was kindled against his people,
        and he abhorred his heritage;<br><br>
        41. he gave them into the hand of the nations,
        so that those who hated them ruled over them.<br><br>
        42. Their enemies oppressed them,
        and they were brought into subjection under their power.<br><br>
        43. Many times he delivered them,
        but they were rebellious in their purposes
        and were brought low through their iniquity.<br><br>
        
        44. Nevertheless, he looked upon their distress,
        when he heard their cry.<br><br>
        45. For their sake he remembered his covenant,
        and relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love.<br><br>
        46. He caused them to be pitied
        by all those who held them captive.<br><br>
        
        47. Save us, O Lord our God,
        and gather us from among the nations,
        that we may give thanks to your holy name
        and glory in your praise.<br><br>
        48. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
        from everlasting to everlasting!
        And let all the people say, "Amen!"
        Praise the Lord!<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 106 is a psalm of confession and remembrance. It acknowledges the sins and rebellion of both the Israelites and their ancestors, recounting specific instances of their disobedience and forgetfulness of God's works. The psalmist recognizes God's faithfulness and steadfast love despite their unfaithfulness, and appeals to God for salvation and restoration.</h4>
            The psalm begins with praise and thanksgiving to the Lord, acknowledging His goodness and enduring steadfast love. The psalmist reflects on the mighty deeds of the Lord and the blessedness of those who observe justice and righteousness.<br><br>

            The psalmist confesses the sins of their ancestors and themselves, acknowledging their iniquity, wickedness, and rebellion against God's wondrous works and abundant steadfast love. They specifically mention the Israelites' rebellion at the Red Sea, when they doubted God's power and complained. Yet, God saved them and demonstrated His mighty power by parting the Red Sea and destroying their adversaries. The psalmist recounts how the Israelites believed in God's words and praised Him.<br><br>
            
            However, the psalmist goes on to describe how the Israelites soon forgot God's works and did not wait for His counsel. They had a craving in the wilderness and tested God. God granted their request but sent a wasting disease among them.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist recalls additional instances of disobedience and rebellion, such as the jealousy of some in the camp toward Moses and Aaron, resulting in the earth swallowing up Dathan and covering Abiram. Fire also broke out, consuming the wicked. The psalmist mentions the incident of the golden calf, when the Israelites exchanged the glory of God for an image of an ox and forgot their Savior. They provoked God's wrath, but Moses intervened and turned away His anger.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist highlights further acts of disobedience, including murmuring in their tents, not obeying the voice of the Lord, yoking themselves to the Baal of Peor, and offering sacrifices to the dead. These actions provoked God to anger, and a plague broke out. Phinehas intervened, and his righteousness was counted to him from generation to generation.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist mentions the incident at the waters of Meribah, where Moses spoke rashly due to the people's rebellion and bitterness of spirit. They also failed to fully carry out God's commands to destroy the nations and ended up mixing with them and serving their idols. The psalmist laments the sacrifices of sons and daughters to demons and the shedding of innocent blood, which polluted the land.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist acknowledges that God's anger was kindled against His people, and He allowed their enemies to rule over them as a consequence of their rebellion. Despite their iniquity and distress, God looked upon them, heard their cry, and remembered His covenant. He relented and showed them compassion in the eyes of their captors.<br><br></p>    
        <p><h4>The psalm concludes with a plea for salvation and restoration, asking God to gather His people from among the nations so they can give thanks to His holy name and glory in His praise. The psalmist blesses the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting, and invites all people to say, "Amen!" Praise the Lord!</h4></p>
