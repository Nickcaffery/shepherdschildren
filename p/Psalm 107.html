        1. Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good,
        for his steadfast love endures forever!<br><br>
        2. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so,
        whom he has redeemed from trouble<br><br>
        3. and gathered in from the lands,
        from the east and from the west,
        from the north and from the south.<br><br>
        
        4. Some wandered in desert wastes,
        finding no way to a city to dwell in;<br><br>
        5. hungry and thirsty,
        their soul fainted within them.<br><br>
        6. Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,
        and he delivered them from their distress.<br><br>
        7. He led them by a straight way
        till they reached a city to dwell in.<br><br>
        8. Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love,
        for his wondrous works to the children of man!<br><br>
        9. For he satisfies the longing soul,
        and the hungry soul he fills with good things.<br><br>
        
        10. Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
        prisoners in affliction and in irons,<br><br>
        11. for they had rebelled against the words of God,
        and spurned the counsel of the Most High.<br><br>
        12. So he bowed their hearts down with hard labor;
        they fell down, with none to help.<br><br>
        13. Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,
        and he delivered them from their distress.<br><br>
        14. He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
        and burst their bonds apart.<br><br>
        15. Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love,
        for his wondrous works to the children of man!<br><br>
        16. For he shatters the doors of bronze
        and cuts in two the bars of iron.<br><br>
        
        17. Some were fools through their sinful ways,
        and because of their iniquities suffered affliction;<br><br>
        18. they loathed any kind of food,
        and they drew near to the gates of death.<br><br>
        19. Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,
        and he delivered them from their distress.<br><br>
        20. He sent out his word and healed them,
        and delivered them from their destruction.<br><br>
        21. Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love,
        for his wondrous works to the children of man!<br><br>
        22. And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving,
        and tell of his deeds in songs of joy!<br><br>
        
        23. Some went down to the sea in ships,
        doing business on the great waters;<br><br>
        24. they saw the deeds of the Lord,
        his wondrous works in the deep.<br><br>
        25. For he commanded and raised the stormy wind,
        which lifted up the waves of the sea.<br><br>
        26. They mounted up to heaven; they went down to the depths;
        their courage melted away in their evil plight;<br><br>
        27. they reeled and staggered like drunken men
        and were at their wits' end.<br><br>
        28. Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,
        and he delivered them from their distress.<br><br>
        29. He made the storm be still,
        and the waves of the sea were hushed.<br><br>
        30. Then they were glad that the waters were quiet,
        and he brought them to their desired haven.<br><br>
        31. Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love,
        for his wondrous works to the children of man!<br><br>
        32. Let them extol him in the congregation of the people,
        and praise him in the assembly of the elders.<br><br>
        
        33. He turns rivers into a desert,
        springs of water into thirsty ground,<br><br>
        34. a fruitful land into a salty waste,
        because of the evil of its inhabitants.<br><br>
        35. He turns a desert into pools of water,
        a parched land into springs of water.<br><br>
        36. And there he lets the hungry dwell,
        and they establish a city to live in;<br><br>
        37. they sow fields and plant vineyards
        and get a fruitful yield.<br><br>
        38. By his blessing they multiply greatly,
        and he does not let their livestock diminish.<br><br>
        
        39. When they are diminished and brought low
        through oppression, evil, and sorrow,<br><br>
        40. he pours contempt on princes
        and makes them wander in trackless wastes;<br><br>
        41. but he raises up the needy out of affliction
        and makes their families like flocks.<br><br>
        42. The upright see it and are glad,
        and all wickedness shuts its mouth.<br><br>
        
        43. Whoever is wise, let him attend to these things;
        let them consider the steadfast love of the Lord.<br><br></p>
