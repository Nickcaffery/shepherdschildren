    <p class="sttext">
        1. I waited patiently for the Lord;
        he inclined to me and heard my cry.<br><br>
        2. He drew me up from the pit of destruction,
        out of the miry bog,
        and set my feet upon a rock,
        making my steps secure.<br><br>
        3. He put a new song in my mouth,
        a song of praise to our God.
        Many will see and fear,
        and put their trust in the Lord.<br><br>
        
        4. Blessed is the man who makes
        the Lord his trust,
        who does not turn to the proud,
        to those who go astray after a lie!<br><br>
        5. You have multiplied, O Lord my God,
        your wondrous deeds and your thoughts toward us;
        none can compare with you!
        I will proclaim and tell of them,
        yet they are more than can be told.<br><br>
        
        6. In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted,
        but you have given me an open ear.
        Burnt offering and sin offering
        you have not required.<br><br>
        7. Then I said, "Behold, I have come;
        in the scroll of the book it is written of me:<br><br>
        8. I delight to do your will, O my God;
        your law is within my heart."<br><br>
        
        9. I have told the glad news of deliverance
        in the great congregation;
        behold, I have not restrained my lips,
        as you know, O Lord.<br><br>
        10. I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart;
        I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation;
        I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness
        from the great congregation.<br><br>
        
        11. As for you, O Lord, you will not restrain
        your mercy from me;
        your steadfast love and your faithfulness will
        ever preserve me!<br><br>
        12. For evils have encompassed me
        beyond number;
        my iniquities have overtaken me,
        and I cannot see;
        they are more than the hairs of my head;
        my heart fails me.<br><br>
        
        13. Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me!
        O Lord, make haste to help me!<br><br>
        14. Let those be put to shame and disappointed altogether
        who seek to snatch away my life;
        let those be turned back and brought to dishonor
        who delight in my hurt!<br><br>
        15. Let those be appalled because of their shame
        who say to me, "Aha, Aha!"<br><br>
        
        16. But may all who seek you
        rejoice and be glad in you;
        may those who love your salvation
        say continually, "Great is the Lord!"<br><br>
        17. As for me, I am poor and needy,
        but the Lord takes thought for me.
        You are my help and my deliverer;
        do not delay, O my God!<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 40 is a song of praise and thanksgiving to God for His deliverance and faithfulness. The psalmist describes their experience of waiting on the Lord, being lifted from a place of destruction, and having their steps secured on solid ground. They express their gratitude by offering a new song of praise, proclaiming God's wondrous deeds.</h4>
            The psalmist acknowledges the blessedness of those who put their trust in the Lord and avoid the company of the proud and those who go astray. They marvel at the abundance of God's wondrous deeds and His thoughts toward humanity. The psalmist acknowledges their inability to fully comprehend or express the extent of God's goodness, but they are determined to proclaim and tell of His works.<br><br>

            The psalmist recognizes that God takes no delight in traditional sacrifices and offerings, but rather desires an open ear and a willing heart. They declare their delight in doing God's will and having His law within their heart.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist testifies to having proclaimed the good news of deliverance in the assembly of believers, not withholding praise for God's faithfulness and salvation. They express their trust in God's mercy and steadfast love, even in the face of numerous evils and the weight of their own iniquities.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist pleads for God's deliverance and help, asking for the shame and disappointment of those who seek to harm them. They desire that their enemies be turned back and brought to dishonor. They call on God to appall those who mock and delight in their suffering.<br><br>
            
            In contrast, the psalmist rejoices in the Lord and invites others to join in gladness. They acknowledge their own state of poverty and neediness but declare that God takes thought for them. They affirm that God is their help and deliverer and implore Him not to delay in coming to their aid.<br><br></p>
