        <p><h4>Psalm 82 is a poetic expression of divine judgment. It begins by describing God presiding over the divine council, where He holds judgment among the gods. The term "gods" here likely refers to divine beings or heavenly beings rather than human rulers or judges.</h4>
            The psalmist questions the actions of these divine beings, asking how long they will judge unjustly and show favoritism to the wicked. They call for justice to be given to the weak, the fatherless, the afflicted, and the destitute. They implore the divine beings to rescue and deliver the vulnerable from the hand of the wicked.<br><br>

            The psalmist criticizes these divine beings, highlighting their lack of knowledge and understanding. They describe them as walking in darkness, causing the foundations of the earth to be shaken. This may imply that their unjust actions have disrupted the order and well-being of society.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist then quotes God speaking to these divine beings, acknowledging them as "gods" and "sons of the Most High." However, they are warned that despite their divine status, they will die like mortals and fall like any prince or ruler.<br><br>
            
            In the final verses, the psalmist calls upon God to arise and judge the earth. They recognize God as the ultimate judge who will inherit all the nations. This concluding plea expresses the psalmist's trust in God's righteous judgment and ultimate authority.<br><br></p>
