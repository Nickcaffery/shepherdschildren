        1. Lord, you have been our dwelling place
        in all generations.<br><br>
        2. Before the mountains were brought forth,
        or ever you had formed the earth and the world,
        from everlasting to everlasting you are God.<br><br>
        
        3. You return man to dust
        and say, "Return, O children of man!"<br><br>
        4. For a thousand years in your sight
        are but as yesterday when it is past,
        or as a watch in the night.<br><br>
        
        5. You sweep them away as with a flood; they are like a dream,
        like grass that is renewed in the morning:<br><br>
        6. in the morning it flourishes and is renewed;
        in the evening it fades and withers.<br><br>
        
        7. For we are brought to an end by your anger;
        by your wrath we are dismayed.<br><br>
        8. You have set our iniquities before you,
        our secret sins in the light of your presence.<br><br>
        
        9. For all our days pass away under your wrath;
        we bring our years to an end like a sigh.<br><br>
        10. The years of our life are seventy,
        or even by reason of strength eighty;
        yet their span is but toil and trouble;
        they are soon gone, and we fly away.<br><br>
        11. Who considers the power of your anger,
        and your wrath according to the fear of you?<br><br>
        
        12. So teach us to number our days
        that we may get a heart of wisdom.<br><br>
        13. Return, O Lord! How long?
        Have pity on your servants!<br><br>
        14. Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love,
        that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.<br><br>
        15. Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,
        and for as many years as we have seen evil.<br><br>
        16. Let your work be shown to your servants,
        and your glorious power to their children.<br><br>
        17. Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us,
        and establish the work of our hands upon us;
        yes, establish the work of our hands!<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 90 is a contemplation on the eternal nature of God, the brevity of human life, and the need for divine wisdom and favor.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by acknowledging that throughout all generations, the Lord has been their dwelling place. They reflect on God's eternal existence, existing before the formation of the earth and the world, and continuing from everlasting to everlasting.<br><br>

            The psalmist contemplates the transient nature of human life, likening it to dust. They acknowledge that God returns humanity to dust, reminding them of their mortality. They contrast the fleeting nature of human life with the everlasting nature of God. A thousand years are like a passing day or a watch in the night in God's sight.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist recognizes the frailty and brevity of human existence, describing it as being swept away like a flood or a dream. They compare human life to grass that flourishes in the morning but fades and withers by evening.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist acknowledges that the anger and wrath of God bring an end to human life. They recognize that God sees their iniquities and secret sins in His presence. They acknowledge that their days pass away under God's wrath, and their years come to an end like a sigh. The psalmist reflects on the toil, trouble, and fleeting nature of human life, noting that the average lifespan may be seventy or eighty years, yet even those years are filled with difficulties and quickly pass away. They contemplate the power of God's anger and the fear that it should inspire.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist prays for God to teach them to number their days, gaining a heart of wisdom in the process. They implore the Lord to return and have pity on His servants. The psalmist asks for satisfaction in the morning with God's steadfast love, so they may rejoice and be glad all their days. They seek gladness in proportion to the afflictions they have experienced and for as many years as they have seen evil. The psalmist desires to witness God's work and His glorious power, desiring the favor of the Lord to be upon them and the establishment of their work.<br><br></p>
