        1. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me,
        for in you my soul takes refuge;
        in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge,
        till the storms of destruction pass by.<br><br>
        2. I cry out to God Most High,
        to God who fulfills his purpose for me.<br><br>

        he will put to shame him who tramples on me. Selah<br><br>
        
        4. My soul is in the midst of lions;

        the children of man, whose teeth are spears and arrows,

        5. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!

        my soul was bowed down.
        They dug a pit in my way,
        but they have fallen into it themselves. Selah<br><br>
        
        7. My heart is steadfast, O God,
        my heart is steadfast!
        I will sing and make melody!<br><br>
        8. Awake, my glory!
        Awake, O harp and lyre!
        I will awake the dawn!<br><br>
        9. I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples;
        I will sing praises to you among the nations.<br><br>
        10. For your steadfast love is great to the heavens,
        your faithfulness to the clouds.<br><br>
        
        11. Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!
        Let your glory be over all the earth!<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 57 is a prayer of David during a time when he was pursued by King Saul and found refuge in a cave. It expresses David's trust in God's protection and calls for God's exaltation and glory.</h4>
            David begins by pleading for God's mercy and refuge. He seeks shelter in the shadow of God's wings, asking for protection until the storms of destruction pass by. David cries out to God Most High, acknowledging that God fulfills His purpose for him and trusting that God will send salvation and put to shame those who oppose him.<br><br>

            Despite being surrounded by enemies likened to lions and fiery beasts with sharp teeth and tongues, David calls upon God to be exalted above the heavens and for His glory to be manifested throughout the earth.<br><br>
            
            David describes the attempts of his enemies to ensnare him, to bring him down and hinder his progress. However, he finds reassurance that the traps laid for him will ultimately lead to the downfall of his adversaries. David's heart remains steadfast in God, and he resolves to sing and make melody, awakening the dawn with praise and thanksgiving.<br><br>
            
            David proclaims his intention to give thanks to the Lord among the peoples and sing praises to Him among the nations. He extols the greatness of God's steadfast love, which reaches to the heavens, and His faithfulness, which extends to the clouds.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with a renewed call for God's exaltation above the heavens and for His glory to be displayed throughout the earth. It emphasizes David's confidence in God's protection, his unwavering devotion, and his desire for God to be honored and exalted by all.<br><br></p>

It encourages believers to take refuge in God, even in the midst of trials, and to offer heartfelt praise and thanksgiving for His steadfast love and faithfulness.
