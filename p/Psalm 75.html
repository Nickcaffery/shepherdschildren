        1. We give thanks to you, O God;
        we give thanks, for your name is near.
        We recount your wondrous deeds.<br><br>
        
        2. "At the set time that I appoint
        I will judge with equity.<br><br>
        3. When the earth totters, and all its inhabitants,
        it is I who keep steady its pillars. Selah<br><br>
        4. I say to the boastful, 'Do not boast,'
        and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up your horn;<br><br>
        5. do not lift up your horn on high,
        or speak with haughty neck.'"<br><br>
        
        6. For not from the east or from the west
        and not from the wilderness comes lifting up,<br><br>
        7. but it is God who executes judgment,
        putting down one and lifting up another.<br><br>
        8. For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup
        with foaming wine, well mixed,
        and he pours out from it,
        and all the wicked of the earth
        shall drain it down to the dregs.<br><br>
        
        9. But I will declare it forever;
        I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.<br><br>
        10. All the horns of the wicked I will cut off,
        but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 75 is a song of thanksgiving and proclamation of God's righteous judgment. It acknowledges God's nearness, recounts His wondrous deeds, and declares that it is He who judges with equity.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by giving thanks to God, emphasizing His proximity and the recounting of His wondrous deeds.<br><br>

            God speaks and declares that He will judge with equity at the appointed time. The psalmist acknowledges God's role in upholding the pillars of the earth and maintaining stability. They warn the boastful and the wicked not to lift up their horns in pride or speak arrogantly.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist declares that it is not from any particular direction or human power that exaltation comes, but it is God who executes judgment. He has the authority to bring down one and lift up another.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist uses the imagery of a cup filled with foaming wine, well mixed, representing the cup of God's judgment. They assert that God pours out this cup, and all the wicked of the earth will drink it to the very last drop, experiencing the full consequences of their wickedness.<br><br>
            
            In contrast, the psalmist declares their commitment to declaring God's righteous judgment forever. They vow to sing praises to the God of Jacob, affirming their faithfulness and trust in Him. They proclaim that the horns of the wicked will be cut off, symbolizing the removal of their power and influence. On the other hand, the horns of the righteous will be lifted up, representing their exaltation and favor from God.<br><br></p>
