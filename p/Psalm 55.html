        1. Give ear to my prayer, O God,
        and hide not yourself from my plea for mercy!<br><br>
        2. Attend to me, and answer me;
        I am restless in my complaint and I moan,<br><br>
        3. because of the noise of the enemy,
        because of the oppression of the wicked.
        For they drop trouble upon me,
        and in anger they bear a grudge against me.<br><br>
        
        4. My heart is in anguish within me;
        the terrors of death have fallen upon me.<br><br>
        5. Fear and trembling come upon me,
        and horror overwhelms me.<br><br>
        6. And I say, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove!
        I would fly away and be at rest;<br><br>
        7. yes, I would wander far away;
        I would lodge in the wilderness; Selah<br><br>
        
        8. I would hurry to find a shelter
        from the raging wind and tempest."<br><br>
        
        9. Destroy, O Lord, divide their tongues;
        for I see violence and strife in the city.<br><br>
        10. Day and night they go around it
        on its walls,
        and iniquity and trouble are within it;<br><br>
        11. ruin is in its midst;
        oppression and fraud
        do not depart from its marketplace.<br><br>
        
        12. For it is not an enemy who taunts me—
        then I could bear it;
        it is not an adversary who deals insolently with me—
        then I could hide from him.<br><br>
        13. But it is you, a man, my equal,
        my companion, my familiar friend.<br><br>
        14. We used to take sweet counsel together;
        within God's house we walked in the throng.<br><br>
        
        15. Let death steal over them;
        let them go down to Sheol alive;
        for evil is in their dwelling place and in their heart.<br><br>
        
        16. But I call to God,
        and the Lord will save me.<br><br>
        17. Evening and morning and at noon
        I utter my complaint and moan,
        and he hears my voice.<br><br>
        18. He redeems my soul in safety
        from the battle that I wage,
        for many are arrayed against me.<br><br>
        19. God will give ear and humble them,
        he who is enthroned from of old, Selah
        because they do not change
        and do not fear God.<br><br>
        
        20. My companion stretched out his hand against his friends;
        he violated his covenant.<br><br>
        21. His speech was smooth as butter,
        yet war was in his heart;
        his words were softer than oil,
        yet they were drawn swords.<br><br>
        
        22. Cast your burden on the Lord,
        and he will sustain you;
        he will never permit
        the righteous to be moved.<br><br>
        
        23. But you, O God, will cast them down
        into the pit of destruction;
        men of blood and treachery
        shall not live out half their days.
        But I will trust in you.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 55 is a heartfelt prayer of David, expressing his distress and seeking God's intervention in the midst of betrayal and conflict. It depicts David's anguish, longing for escape, and ultimately his trust in God's deliverance.</h4>
            David begins by pleading with God to listen and not hide Himself from his plea for mercy. He describes his restlessness, complaint, and moaning, as he is surrounded by enemies and oppressed by the wicked. David feels troubled and targeted by their malicious actions.<br><br>

            David expresses the anguish within his heart, feeling the terrors of death and overwhelmed by fear and trembling. He longs to escape, desiring wings like a dove to fly away and find rest in the wilderness.<br><br>
            
            David calls upon the Lord to destroy and divide the tongues of his enemies. He observes violence, strife, iniquity, and trouble in the city, with ruin, oppression, and fraud prevailing. He laments the betrayal and insolence of someone close to him, a former companion and familiar friend, with whom he used to share counsel and walk in God's house.<br><br>
            
            David expresses a desire for divine judgment upon the wicked, calling for death and descent to Sheol (the realm of the dead) for those who dwell in evil. However, he affirms his trust in God and calls upon Him for salvation. David commits to expressing his complaints and moans to God throughout the day, confident that God hears his voice and redeems his soul from battle.<br><br>
            
            David expresses his assurance that God will humble the wicked because they do not change and do not fear God. He reflects on the betrayal of his companion, noting the deceptive nature of his smooth speech and the war in his heart concealed behind soft words.<br><br>
            
            In the midst of his distress, David encourages casting one's burden upon the Lord, affirming that God will sustain the righteous and prevent them from being moved. He entrusts his situation to God, acknowledging that God will cast down the wicked into destruction, preventing them from living out their days. Despite the turmoil, David reaffirms his trust in God.<br><br></p>
