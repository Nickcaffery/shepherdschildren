        1. Praise is due to you, O God, in Zion,
        and to you shall vows be performed.<br><br>
        2. O you who hear prayer,
        to you shall all flesh come.<br><br>
        3. When iniquities prevail against me,
        you atone for our transgressions.<br><br>
        4. Blessed is the one you choose and bring near,
        to dwell in your courts!
        We shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house,
        the holiness of your temple!<br><br>
        
        5. By awesome deeds you answer us with righteousness,
        O God of our salvation,
        the hope of all the ends of the earth
        and of the farthest seas;<br><br>
        6. the one who by his strength established the mountains,
        being girded with might;<br><br>
        7. who stills the roaring of the seas,
        the roaring of their waves,
        the tumult of the peoples,<br><br>
        8. so that those who dwell at the ends of the earth are in awe at your signs.<br><br>
        
        9. You visit the earth and water it;
        you greatly enrich it;
        the river of God is full of water;
        you provide their grain,
        for so you have prepared it.<br><br>
        10. You water its furrows abundantly,
        settling its ridges,
        softening it with showers,
        and blessing its growth.<br><br>
        11. You crown the year with your bounty;
        your wagon tracks overflow with abundance.<br><br>
        12. The pastures of the wilderness overflow,
        the hills gird themselves with joy,<br><br>
        13. the meadows clothe themselves with flocks,
        the valleys deck themselves with grain,
        they shout and sing together for joy.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 65 is a hymn of praise and thanksgiving to God for His abundant provision and the display of His power in creation. It emphasizes God's faithfulness, His forgiveness of sins, and His bountiful blessings.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by acknowledging that praise is due to God in Zion and vows should be performed to Him. All flesh, representing all people, come before God to offer prayers. The psalmist recognizes that when iniquities prevail, God provides atonement for their transgressions.<br><br>

            The chosen and brought near ones are blessed to dwell in God's courts and experience the goodness and holiness of His house. They find satisfaction in being in His presence.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist declares that God answers with righteousness through awesome deeds. He is the hope of all the earth and the farthest seas. God's strength established the mountains and He has power over the roaring seas and the tumult of the peoples. The psalmist acknowledges that the signs of God inspire awe even in those who dwell at the ends of the earth.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist further acknowledges God's provision and care for the earth. God visits the earth, waters it, and greatly enriches it. The river of God is full of water, and He provides grain for the people. God waters the furrows, settles the ridges, and blesses the growth of the land. The psalmist praises God for crowning the year with His bounty, causing wagon tracks to overflow with abundance. The pastures, hills, meadows, and valleys all celebrate and rejoice together in God's blessings.<br><br></p>
