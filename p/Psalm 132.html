        1. Remember, O Lord, in David's favor,
        all the hardships he endured,<br><br>
        2. how he swore to the Lord
        and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,<br><br>
        3. "I will not enter my house
        or get into my bed,<br><br>
        4. I will not give sleep to my eyes
        or slumber to my eyelids,<br><br>
        5. until I find a place for the Lord,
        a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob."<br><br>
        
        6. Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah;
        we found it in the fields of Jaar.<br><br>
        7. "Let us go to his dwelling place;
        let us worship at his footstool!"<br><br>
        
        8. Arise, O Lord, and go to your resting place,
        you and the ark of your might.<br><br>
        9. Let your priests be clothed with righteousness,
        and let your saints shout for joy.<br><br>
        10. For the sake of your servant David,
        do not turn away the face of your anointed one.<br><br>
        
        11. The Lord swore to David a sure oath
        from which he will not turn back:
        "One of the sons of your body
        I will set on your throne.<br><br>
        12. If your sons keep my covenant
        and my testimonies that I shall teach them,
        their sons also forever
        shall sit on your throne."<br><br>
        
        13. For the Lord has chosen Zion;
        he has desired it for his dwelling place:<br><br>
        14. "This is my resting place forever;
        here I will dwell, for I have desired it.<br><br>
        15. I will abundantly bless her provisions;
        I will satisfy her poor with bread.<br><br>
        16. Her priests I will clothe with salvation,
        and her saints will shout for joy.<br><br>
        17. There I will make a horn to sprout for David;
        I have prepared a lamp for my anointed.<br><br>
        18. His enemies I will clothe with shame,
        but on him his crown will shine."<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 132 is a psalm that focuses on David's devotion to building a dwelling place for the Lord and God's promise to establish David's lineage on the throne. It speaks of God's desire for a resting place in Zion and His commitment to bless and exalt David's descendants.</h4>
            The psalm begins with a plea for the Lord to remember David's hardships and his vow to find a dwelling place for the Lord. David was determined to provide a place for the Lord to dwell, refusing to rest until this was accomplished.<br><br>

            The psalmist recalls the discovery of the place designated for the Lord's dwelling in Ephrathah and Jaar. The people express their desire to worship and honor the Lord at His dwelling place, acknowledging His authority and presence.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist calls on the Lord to arise and go to His resting place, accompanied by the ark of His might. They pray for the priests to be clothed with righteousness and for the saints to shout for joy, anticipating a time of worship and celebration in the presence of the Lord.<br><br>
            
            The psalm recounts the Lord's oath to David, promising that one of his descendants would sit on the throne forever, as long as they remain faithful to the Lord's covenant and teachings. This speaks of the establishment of David's dynasty and the perpetuity of his rule through generations.<br><br>
            
            The psalm declares that the Lord has chosen Zion as His dwelling place, a place where He desires to rest forever. The Lord promises to abundantly bless the provisions of Zion, satisfying the poor with bread. He will clothe the priests with salvation and bring joy to His saints.<br><br>
            
            The psalm concludes with the assurance of the Lord's favor towards David's descendants. The Lord will make a horn (symbol of strength) sprout for David, and He has prepared a lamp (symbol of guidance and prosperity) for His anointed one. The enemies of David's lineage will be clothed with shame, while David's crown will shine with honor.<br><br></p>
