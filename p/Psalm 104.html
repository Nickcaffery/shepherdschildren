        1. Bless the Lord, O my soul!
        O Lord my God, you are very great!
        You are clothed with splendor and majesty,<br><br>
        2. covering yourself with light as with a garment,
        stretching out the heavens like a tent.<br><br>
        3. He lays the beams of his chambers on the waters;
        he makes the clouds his chariot;
        he rides on the wings of the wind;<br><br>
        4. he makes his messengers winds,
        his ministers a flaming fire.<br><br>
        
        5. He set the earth on its foundations,
        so that it should never be moved.<br><br>
        6. You covered it with the deep as with a garment;
        the waters stood above the mountains.<br><br>
        7. At your rebuke they fled;
        at the sound of your thunder they took to flight.<br><br>
        8. The mountains rose, the valleys sank down
        to the place that you appointed for them.<br><br>
        9. You set a boundary that they may not pass,
        so that they might not again cover the earth.<br><br>
        
        10. You make springs gush forth in the valleys;
        they flow between the hills;<br><br>
        11. they give drink to every beast of the field;
        the wild donkeys quench their thirst.<br><br>
        12. Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell;
        they sing among the branches.<br><br>
        13. From your lofty abode you water the mountains;
        the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your work.<br><br>
        
        14. You cause the grass to grow for the livestock
        and plants for man to cultivate,
        that he may bring forth food from the earth<br><br>
        15. and wine to gladden the heart of man,
        oil to make his face shine
        and bread to strengthen man's heart.<br><br>
        
        16. The trees of the Lord are watered abundantly,
        the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.<br><br>
        17. In them the birds build their nests;
        the stork has her home in the fir trees.<br><br>
        18. The high mountains are for the wild goats;
        the rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.<br><br>
        
        19. He made the moon to mark the seasons;
        the sun knows its time for setting.<br><br>
        20. You make darkness, and it is night,
        when all the beasts of the forest creep about.<br><br>
        21. The young lions roar for their prey,
        seeking their food from God.<br><br>
        22. When the sun rises, they steal away
        and lie down in their dens.<br><br>
        23. Man goes out to his work
        and to his labor until the evening.<br><br>
        
        24. O Lord, how manifold are your works!
        In wisdom have you made them all;
        the earth is full of your creatures.<br><br>
        25. Here is the sea, great and wide,
        which teems with creatures innumerable,
        living things both small and great.<br><br>
        26. There go the ships,
        and Leviathan, which you formed to play in it.<br><br>
        
        27. These all look to you,
        to give them their food in due season.<br><br>
        28. When you give it to them, they gather it up;
        when you open your hand, they are filled with good things.<br><br>
        29. When you hide your face, they are dismayed;
        when you take away their breath, they die
        and return to their dust.<br><br>
        30. When you send forth your Spirit, they are created,
        and you renew the face of the ground.<br><br>
        
        31. May the glory of the Lord endure forever;
        may the Lord rejoice in his works,<br><br>
        32. who looks on the earth and it trembles,
        who touches the mountains and they smoke!<br><br>
        33. I will sing to the Lord as long as I live;
        I will sing praise to my God while I have being.<br><br>
        34. May my meditation be pleasing to him,
        for I rejoice in the Lord.<br><br>
        35. Let sinners be consumed from the earth,
        and let the wicked be no more!
        Bless the Lord, O my soul!
        Praise the Lord!<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 104 is a hymn of praise that celebrates the greatness and creative power of God. It describes the wonders of creation, the provision of food and sustenance, and the Lord's ongoing care for all living creatures.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by calling their soul to bless the Lord, acknowledging His greatness and splendor. They describe God's majestic presence, being clothed with light and stretching out the heavens like a tent.<br><br>

            The psalmist praises God's creative power, noting how He set the earth on its foundations and covered it with deep waters. They highlight God's control over the elements, with the waters fleeing at His rebuke and the mountains and valleys being formed according to His plan. The psalmist recognizes the boundaries set by God, preventing the waters from covering the earth again.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist marvels at God's provision for all creatures, from springs that flow in the valleys to quench the thirst of animals, to the lush habitat of birds and the satisfaction of the earth through God's watering of the mountains. They acknowledge how God causes grass to grow for livestock and plants for humans to cultivate, providing food, wine, oil, and bread for their well-being.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist observes the order and purpose in nature, such as the trees watered by God that provide homes for birds, the mountains as habitats for wild goats, and rocks serving as refuge for rock badgers. They acknowledge the role of the moon and the sun in marking the seasons and the cycle of day and night, with animals seeking their food from God and humans going about their work.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist reflects on the manifold works of the Lord, praising His wisdom in creation. They acknowledge the abundance of creatures in the sea and the ships that sail upon it. They mention Leviathan, a mythical sea creature, as an example of God's playful creation.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist emphasizes the dependence of all creatures on God's provision. They recognize that all living things look to God for food and sustenance, and when He provides, they are filled with good things. They acknowledge that when God hides His face or takes away their breath, they perish and return to dust. Yet, they acknowledge that when God sends forth His Spirit, new life is created, and the face of the ground is renewed.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist prays for the enduring glory of the Lord and expresses a desire for the Lord to rejoice in His works. They commit to singing praise to the Lord as long as they live and finding joy in meditating on Him. The psalmist calls for the consumption of sinners and the eradication of the wicked. The psalm concludes with a final blessing of the Lord and a call to praise Him.<br><br></p>
