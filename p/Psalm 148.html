            The psalmist continues by summoning the sun, moon, and shining stars to praise the Lord. They call upon the highest heavens and the waters above the heavens to offer praise. The psalmist emphasizes that all of creation should praise the name of the Lord because He commanded their creation and established them forever by His decree.<br><br>

            The psalmist then calls for praise from the earth, addressing the great sea creatures, the depths, fire, hail, snow, mist, and stormy wind. They urge the mountains, hills, fruit trees, cedars, beasts, livestock, creeping things, and flying birds to join in praising the Lord.<br><br>
