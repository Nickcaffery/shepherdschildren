        1. Bless the Lord, O my soul,
        and all that is within me,
        bless his holy name!<br><br>
        2. Bless the Lord, O my soul,
        and forget not all his benefits,<br><br>
        3. who forgives all your iniquity,
        who heals all your diseases,<br><br>
        4. who redeems your life from the pit,
        who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy,<br><br>
        5. who satisfies you with good
        so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.<br><br>
        
        6. The Lord works righteousness
        and justice for all who are oppressed.<br><br>
        7. He made known his ways to Moses,
        his acts to the people of Israel.<br><br>
        8. The Lord is merciful and gracious,
        slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.<br><br>
        9. He will not always chide,
        nor will he keep his anger forever.<br><br>
        10. He does not deal with us according to our sins,
        nor repay us according to our iniquities.<br><br>
        11. For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
        so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him;<br><br>
        12. as far as the east is from the west,
        so far does he remove our transgressions from us.<br><br>
        13. As a father shows compassion to his children,
        so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear him.<br><br>
        
        14. For he knows our frame;
        he remembers that we are dust.<br><br>
        15. As for man, his days are like grass;
        he flourishes like a flower of the field;<br><br>
        16. for the wind passes over it, and it is gone,
        and its place knows it no more.<br><br>
        17. But the steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him,
        and his righteousness to children's children,<br><br>
        18. to those who keep his covenant
        and remember to do his commandments.<br><br>
        19. The Lord has established his throne in the heavens,
        and his kingdom rules over all.<br><br>
        
        20. Bless the Lord, O you his angels,
        you mighty ones who do his word,
        obeying the voice of his word!<br><br>
        21. Bless the Lord, all his hosts,
        his ministers, who do his will!<br><br>
        22. Bless the Lord, all his works,
        in all places of his dominion.
        Bless the Lord, O my soul!<br><br></p>

        <h1 class="hes">Commentary</h1>
        <p><h4>Psalm 103 is a psalm of praise and thanksgiving, calling the psalmist's soul to bless the Lord and remember His countless benefits. It extols the mercy, love, and righteousness of God and emphasizes His compassion towards His people.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by calling their soul to bless the Lord and everything within them to praise His holy name. They remind themselves not to forget all the benefits God has bestowed upon them.<br><br>

            The psalmist acknowledges God as the one who forgives iniquities, heals diseases, redeems lives from destruction, and crowns with steadfast love and mercy. They highlight how God satisfies with good things, renewing one's youth like the eagle's soaring strength.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist declares that the Lord works righteousness and justice, particularly for the oppressed. They recall how God made His ways known to Moses and His acts known to the people of Israel. The psalmist affirms the merciful, gracious, slow-to-anger, and abounding-in-love nature of the Lord. They recognize that God does not deal with people according to their sins or iniquities, and His love and forgiveness extend infinitely.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist uses vivid imagery to depict the vastness of God's love and forgiveness. They compare it to the height of the heavens above the earth and the distance from the east to the west. The psalmist draws a parallel between God's compassion and that of a father towards his children.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist acknowledges the frailty of human beings, comparing their days to grass and flowers that wither and fade away. They emphasize that the steadfast love of the Lord, however, is eternal and reaches from everlasting to everlasting. This love and righteousness extend to future generations and those who keep God's covenant and remember to do His commandments.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist affirms that the Lord has established His throne in the heavens, and His kingdom rules over all. They call upon the angels, the hosts, the ministers, and all the works of God to join in blessing and praising the Lord.<br><br></p>
