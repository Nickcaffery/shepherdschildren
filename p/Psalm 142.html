        1. With my voice I cry out to the Lord;

        I tell my trouble before him.<br><br>
        
        3. When my spirit faints within me,
        you know my way!

        4. Look to the right and see:

        no refuge remains to me;
        no one cares for my soul.<br><br>
        
        5. I cry to you, O Lord;
        I say, "You are my refuge,
        my portion in the land of the living."<br><br>
        6. Attend to my cry,
        for I am brought very low!
        Deliver me from my persecutors,
        for they are too strong for me!<br><br>
        7. Bring me out of prison,
        that I may give thanks to your name!
        The righteous will surround me,
        for you will deal bountifully with me.<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 142 is a heartfelt cry for help and deliverance from the psalmist to the Lord. The psalmist pours out their complaint and trouble before God, seeking His mercy and refuge.</h4>
            The psalmist acknowledges that their spirit is fainting within them, and they are aware that God knows their way. They describe the situation they are in, where their enemies have laid a trap for them in the path they walk. They express a sense of loneliness and abandonment, feeling unnoticed, without refuge, and without anyone caring for their soul.<br><br>

            In their distress, the psalmist cries out to the Lord, declaring Him as their refuge and portion in the land of the living. They ask the Lord to attend to their cry because they are brought very low. The psalmist pleads for deliverance from their persecutors, recognizing their own weakness in comparison to the strength of their enemies.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist appeals to the Lord to bring them out of their metaphorical prison so that they may give thanks to His name. They anticipate being surrounded by the righteous, expressing faith in God's promise to deal bountifully with them.<br><br></p>
