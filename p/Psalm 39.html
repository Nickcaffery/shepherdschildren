        1. I said, "I will guard my ways,
        that I may not sin with my tongue;
        I will guard my mouth with a muzzle,
        so long as the wicked are in my presence."<br><br>
        2. I was mute and silent;
        I held my peace to no avail,
        and my distress grew worse.<br><br>
        3. My heart became hot within me.
        As I mused, the fire burned;
        then I spoke with my tongue:<br><br>
        
        4. "O Lord, make me know my end
        and what is the measure of my days;
        let me know how fleeting I am!<br><br>
        5. Behold, you have made my days a few handbreadths,
        and my lifetime is as nothing before you.
        Surely all mankind stands as a mere breath! Selah<br><br>
        6. Surely a man goes about as a shadow!
        Surely for nothing they are in turmoil;<br><br>
        
        7. "And now, O Lord, for what do I wait?
        My hope is in you.<br><br>
        8. Deliver me from all my transgressions.
        Do not make me the scorn of the fool!<br><br>
        9. I am mute; I do not open my mouth,
        for it is you who have done it.<br><br>
        10. Remove your stroke from me;
        I am spent by the hostility of your hand.<br><br>
        11. When you discipline a man
        with rebukes for sin,
        you consume like a moth what is dear to him;
        surely all mankind is a mere breath! Selah<br><br>
        
        12. "Hear my prayer, O Lord,
        and give ear to my cry;
        hold not your peace at my tears!
        For I am a sojourner with you,
        a guest, like all my fathers.<br><br>
        13. Look away from me, that I may smile again,
        before I depart and am no more!"<br><br></p>

        <p><h4>Psalm 39 is a reflection on the brevity of human life and a prayer for deliverance from sin and the scorn of others. The psalmist contemplates the fleeting nature of life and acknowledges their own mortality. They put their hope in the Lord and implore Him for deliverance and mercy.</h4>
            The psalmist begins by declaring their intention to guard their ways and refrain from sinning with their tongue in the presence of the wicked. They try to remain silent and mute, but their distress only grows worse. Eventually, they cannot contain their emotions any longer and speak.<br><br>

            The psalmist then turns their thoughts and prayers to the Lord, asking Him to make them aware of their own mortality and the brevity of their days. They acknowledge that their days are as fleeting as a few handbreadths and their lifetime is nothing compared to God. They reflect on the temporary nature of humanity and the fact that people are in turmoil, seemingly for no purpose.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist expresses their hope in the Lord and implores Him to deliver them from their transgressions. They ask God not to make them the object of scorn from fools. They remain silent, recognizing that it is God who has brought them to this point. They request that God remove His affliction from them, as they are spent and exhausted by His hand of hostility. The psalmist acknowledges that God's discipline, which consumes like a moth, affects what is dear to them.<br><br>
            
            The psalmist appeals to the Lord, asking Him to hear their prayer and not remain silent in the face of their tears. They recognize that they are but a temporary sojourner, a guest in the world, just like their ancestors. They ask God to look away from them, allowing them to smile again, before their departure from the world.<br><br></p>
