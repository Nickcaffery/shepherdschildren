        1. Incline your ear, O Lord, and answer me,
        for I am poor and needy.<br><br>
        2. Preserve my life, for I am godly;
        save your servant, who trusts in youâ€”you are my God.<br><br>
        3. Be gracious to me, O Lord,
        for to you do I cry all the day.<br><br>
        4. Gladden the soul of your servant,
        for to you, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.<br><br>
        
        5. For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving,
        abounding in steadfast love to all who call upon you.<br><br>
        6. Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer;
        listen to my plea for grace.<br><br>
        7. In the day of my trouble I call upon you,
        for you answer me.<br><br>
        
        8. There is none like you among the gods, O Lord,
        nor are there any works like yours.<br><br>
        9. All the nations you have made shall come
        and worship before you, O Lord,
        and shall glorify your name.<br><br>
        10. For you are great and do wondrous things;
        you alone are God.<br><br>
        
        11. Teach me your way, O Lord,
        that I may walk in your truth;
        unite my heart to fear your name.<br><br>
        12. I give thanks to you, O Lord my God, with my whole heart,
        and I will glorify your name forever.<br><br>
        13. For great is your steadfast love toward me;
        you have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.<br><br>
        
        14. O God, insolent men have risen up against me;
        a band of ruthless men seeks my life,
        and they do not set you before them.<br><br>
        15. But you, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious,
        slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.<br><br>
        16. Turn to me and be gracious to me;
        give your strength to your servant,
        and save the son of your maidservant.<br><br>
        17. Show me a sign of your favor,
        that those who hate me may see and be put to shame
        because you, Lord, have helped me and comforted me.<br><br></p>
